10282.6,"“machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make”    nick bostrom        to put it frankly, artificial intelligence will eventually replace jobs. workers in a variety of industries, from healthcare to agriculture and manufacturing, should expect to witness hiring disruptions as a result of artificial intelligence.    if history has taught us anything, it is that disruptive paradigm-shifting business ideas not only make a fortune for the innovators, but they also build the groundwork for new business models, market entrants, and job opportunities which will inevitably follow. it is true that robots today or in future will eventually replace humans for many jobs, but so did innovative farming equipment for humans and horses during the industrial revolution. but that does not mean that our jobs as humans will end here. we, on the other hand, will be required to generate and provide value in whole new ways for entirely new business models as a result of these changes.    according to 71% of the businesses worldwide, artificial intelligence can help people overcome critical and challenging problems and live better lives. artificial intelligence consultants at work will be more or equally fair, according to a whopping 83% of corporate leaders. these results demonstrate that artificial intelligence is steadily extending its measures, yielding societal benefits and allowing citizens to live more fulfilling lives.    increase in automation and jobs where humans can’t compete    since the advent of industry 4.0, businesses are moving at a fast pace towards automation, be it any type of industry. in 2013, researchers at oxford university did a study on the future of work. they concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines. machine learning is responsible for this disruption. it is the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence. it allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can do.    a research was conducted by the employees of kaggle wherein an algorithm was to be created to take images of a human eye and diagnose an eye disease known as diabetic retinopathy. here, the winning algorithm could match the diagnosis given by human ophthalmologists. another study was conducted wherein an algorithm should be created to grade high school essays. here too, the winning algorithm could match the grade given by human teachers.    thus, we can safely conclude that given the right data, machines can easily outperform human beings in tasks like these. a teacher might read 10,000 essays over a 40-year career; an ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes but a machine can read a million essays and see a million eyes within minutes.    thus, it is convenient to conclude that we have no chance of competing with machines on frequent, high volume tasks.     tasks where machines don’t work    but there are tasks where human beings have an upper hand, and that is, in novel tasks. machines can’t handle things they haven’t seen many times before. the fundamental rule of machine learning is that it learns from large volumes of past data. but humans don’t; we have the ability of seemingly connecting disparate threads to solve problems we haven’t seen before.     percy spencer was a physicist working on radar during world war 2 where he noticed that the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar. here, he was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation with his knowledge of cooking in order to invent the microwave oven. now this sort of cross pollination happens to each one of us several times in a day. thus, machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations.     now as we all know that around 92% of talented professionals believe that soft skills such as human interactions and fostering relationships matter much more than hard skills in being successful in managing a workplace. perhaps, these are the kind of tasks that machines can never compete with humans at.     also, creative tasks: the copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab customers’ attention and will have to stand out of the crowd. business strategy means finding gaps in the market and accordingly working on them. since machines cannot outperform humans in novel tasks, it will be humans who would be creating these campaigns and strategies.     human contact would be essential in care-giving and educational-related work responsibilities, and technology would take a backseat. health screenings and customer service face-to-face communication would advocate for human contact, with artificial intelligence playing a supporting role.     so, what does this mean for the future of work? the future state of any single job lies in the answer to one single question: to what extent is the job reducible to tackling frequent high-volume tasks and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations?        today machines diagnose diseases and grade exam papers, over the coming years they’re going to conduct audits, they’re going to read boilerplate from legal contracts. but does that mean we’re not going to be needing accountants and lawyers? wrong. we’re still going to need them for complex tax structuring, for path breaking litigation. it will only get tougher to get these jobs as machine learning will shrink their ranks.     amazon has recruited more than 100,000 robots in its warehouses to help move goods and products around more effectively, and its warehouse workforce has expanded by more than 80,000 people. humans pick and pack goods (amazon has over 480,000,000 products on its “shelves”), while robots move orders throughout the enormous warehouses, therefore reducing “the amount of walking required of workers, making amazon pickers more efficient and less exhausted.” furthermore, because amazon no longer requires aisle space for humans, the robots enable amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush-hour traffic.” more inventory under one roof offers better selection for customers, and a higher density of shelf space equals more inventory under one roof.    kodak vs instagram    kodak, once an undisputed giant of the photography industry, had a 90% share in the usa market in 1976, and by 1984, they were employing 1,45,000 people. but in the year 2012, they had a net worth of negative $1 billion and they had to declare bankruptcy. why? because they failed to predict the importance of exponential trends when it comes to technology. on the other hand, instagram, a digital photography company started in 2012 with 13 employees and later they were sold to facebook for $1 billion. this is so ironic because kodak pioneered digital photography and actually invented the first digital camera but unfortunately thought of it as a mere product and didn’t pay attention towards it and this created the problem.      we live in an era of artificial intelligence (ai), which has given us tremendous computing power, storage space, and information access. we were given the spinning wheel in the first, electricity in the second, and computers in the third industrial revolution by the exponential growth of technology.    airbnb and its breakthrough idea!    airbnb, which is a giant start-up and is known for enabling homeowners to rent out their homes and couches to travellers, for example, “is now creating a new artificial intelligence system that will empower its designers and product engineers to literally take ideas from the drawing board and convert them into actual products almost instantly.” this might be a significant breakthrough whether you’re a designer, engineer, or other type of technologist.    differences that automation brings onto the table:     there are three key changes that automation can bring about at the macro level:     changes in capability demandgender imbalance in workforce redeploymentfirm reorganization.     sectors that might be in trouble    artificial intelligence isn’t just a fad. tractica, a market research firm, published a report in 2016 that predicted “annual global revenue for artificial intelligence products and services will expand from 643.7 million in 2016 to $36.8 billion by 2025, a 57-fold increase over that time span.” as a result, it is the it industry’s fastest-growing segment of any size.”    the reduction in need for people as a result of artificial intelligence and related technologies, which resulted in job layoffs, was a cause of fear. in india alone, job losses in the it sector have reportedly reached 1,000 in the last year, owing to the integration of new and advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.     most of the it companies such as infosys, wipro, tcs, and cognizant have reduced their employee base in india and are recruiting less, while engaging more personnel in the united states and investing heavily in “centres of innovation.” artificial intelligence and data science, which are currently the trending aspects that require fewer people and are primarily located abroad, aren’t helping the prospects of local employees. another factor is that the computer industry is continuously growing and would develop to a size of two million workers. unfortunately, it’s a drop in the bucket compared to what robots are doing to information technology’s less-skilled brothers.     large e-commerce sites that used to be operated by armies of people are now manned by 200 robots produced by greyorange, which is an indian company based out in gurgaon. these indefatigable robots lift and stack boxes 24 hours a day, with only a 30-minute break for recharging, and have cut employees by up to 80%. for efficiency, this is a victory but a disaster for job prospects.     concluding remarks    internal re-skilling and redeployment of staff is a critical requirement of the hour. artificial intelligence has presented indian policymakers with epistemological, scientific, and ethical issues. this requires us to abandon regular, linear, and non-disruptive mental patterns. the tale of artificial intelligence’s influence on individuals and their occupations will only be told over time. it is up to us to upskill ourselves and look for ways to stay current with the industry’s current trends and demands.     so, will machines be able to take over many of our jobs? the answer is a resounding yes. however, for every job that is taken over by robots, there will be an equal number of positions available for people to do. some of these human vocations will be artistic in nature. others will necessitate humans honing superhuman cognitive abilities. humans and machines can form symbiotic relationships, assisting each other in doing what they do best. in the future, people and machines may be able to collaborate and work together towards a common goal for any business they work for.",71,29,0.4199999958,0.1053740779768177,9.303921568627452,0.10783870826714854,3.7647041107578403,102.33893414552396,949,2.696522655426765,6,6.808219178082192
10744.4,"introduction    where is this disruptive technology taking us? take it or leave it, disruptive technology always creates new jobs much more than depleted jobs. you might notice certain jobs disappearing but those jobs are the jobs that transform humans to robots, to machines, and the technology is creating machines to replace them.  technology creates the data analysis tools to manipulate and create custom scenarios using artificial intelligence (ai), big data and machine learning (ml) algorithms to predict and drive consumer behavior. data analytics tools, such as google analytics , and others are available today for free, and, if used correctly, can help organizations save millions, maybe billions of dollars of sales and marketing.        how machine will replace humans?    before i go on, i think it’s best to level set on what constitutes machines. in the context of this article , machines describe computers and computerized equipment, like robots, that have been programmed to learn, sometimes like humans. occasionally we call this artificial intelligence (ai), other times we call this machine learning, and still other times we call this robotics. and yes, these are technically different things. these bots are more efficient than humans in some specific domains and are growing smarter with each passing day. they can do some really tough tasks which are considered difficult for any human being.  but, within the broad discussion related to the future of work, these are totally interrelated. factory floors deploy robots that are increasingly driven by machine learning algorithms such that they can adjust to people working alongside them. a machine can work efficiently only it has abundant data and information about the work which is being imparted daily to them. but with every forward step & advancement in technology, a threat is proliferating, a threat of being replaced on our work front. every passing day is sealing some jobs for humans all over the globe. similarly, ai is being used to turn hand-drawn sketches (done by humans) into digital source code.    role of machines in companies and its future:    companies are clearly developing their ai and robotics expertise with the idea that through these technological innovations they’ll be able to    cut costsincrease efficienciesoffer new value propositionsexecute new business models or all of the above.    of course, it’s not just machines and creatives working together either. in another example, amazon has employed more than 100,000 robots in its warehouses to efficiently move things around while it has increased its warehouse workforce by more than 80,000. humans, in amazon’s case, do the picking and packing of goods while robots move orders around the giant warehouses, essentially cutting “down on the walking required of workers, making amazon pickers more efficient and less tired.” plus, the robots “allow amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush-hour traffic because they no longer need aisle space for humans. the greater density of shelf space means more inventory under one roof, which means better selection for customers.”        why machines can replace humans?    during the next few decades (or maybe sooner), the notion of work and whether it is handled by a human or a virtual being will hinge on predictability. as they are starting to do today, machines will manage the routine while humans take on the unpredictable – tasks that require creativity, problem-solving, and flexibility. in this context, robotics should be seen not only as a means to improve operations efficiency but also to improve the quality of life for workers.    although it is obvious that human factors involved in a work activity impact job automation, it is also true that highly repetitive tasks—and even mechanical ones—are ideal for robots. besides greater efficiency and speed, automation leads to a lower risk of accidents, greater control and autonomy, and above all, fewer costs for organizations.        are machines more diligent than humans?    although artificial intelligence and machine learning make us believe that robots are endowed with superior intelligence, in fact they don’t yet have the ability to learn from experience and to respond to unknowns. so as things stand, however much processing speed and automatic learning a robot has, it doesn’t beat factors innate to the human brain. humans are still a very essential part of the process. think about delivering services to a client. most customer challenges are routine, but humans play a very important role in addressing new issues, solving them the first time they appear, and then consolidating the process into the system.        machines vs. humans – which is premium?    while machines and humans are placed in proximity,  robots can be expensive, but this doesn’t apply to all types, especially those based on robotic process automation (rpa), where the development process incorporates algorithms that significantly reduce costs.    moreover, think of how domestic robots—be it a vacuum cleaner, a lawn mower or a pool cleaner—are increasingly part of our daily lives. this level of consumption that robotics has attained makes it affordable to automate tasks in modern homes to obtain greater control, security and comfort.        man and machines together    the division between humans and machines has been clear – i’m here, the machine is there – but that boundary is getting fuzzier. smart prosthetics fuse seamlessly with our bodies, making up for lost limbs or providing additional strength, stability, or resilience, as seen in exoskeletons donned by assembly line workers.    we use our smartphones symbiotically, but what if they were integrated directly into our bodies? think a smartphone in the form of a contact lens capable of transparently delivering augmented reality images straight to the brain. think it sounds like science fiction? think again. the first prototypes have already been built.    soon, brain-computer interfaces could become seamless as well, creating a new synergistic relationship between the cloud and us. at that point, the question of who knows what would be moot; you ask me a question and i know the answer. sometimes that answer will be stored in my own neural circuitry, but most of the time it would come from the connection of my neurons to the web. our brain’s decision process is influenced by the way it has been “educated” by the cultural context. these external factors are influencing our decision processes to the point that in certain situations, we can legitimately claim that influence has been so strong that our brains can’t be held accountable for the choices made. the point i’m trying to make is that we humans are in symbiosis with our cultural environment and the tools – both physical and conceptual – that we have been taught to use. my guess is that the transformation will be subtle.        conclusion    practically speaking, robots growing to the point that they take over the world and then start creating smarter, better robots are impractical and should not even be a concern. none of this is expected in the near future, not by a long shot. if you’ve been to an atm, waited for a pc to boot up after a catastrophic failure, or had a game crash on your x box just when you were about to reach a checkpoint, you understand that we are not in a world where machines do everything perfectly right. before they can take over all of our jobs, they need to be able to do theirs’ flawlessly; until then, we can depend on humans to mess up our lives.         this isn’t a win-or-lose situation. we’re going to wind up as a partner to our smarter machines, and that partnership will be fostered by our augmentation through technology. machines will play an essential role in this augmentation and, as with any successful technology, they will fall below our level of perception. in the end, the revolution will be silent and invisible.",58,26,0.3809523764172336,0.12334801762114538,6.676470588235294,0.07286399207239766,2.699733832123077,49.620378601302804,681,2.657856093979442,3,6.722466960352423
11206.2,"in future or in upcoming years humans and machines are going to work together in every field of work. in upcoming days machines will be the need for every human being. machines [ai technology] will do the work which humans are incapable of doing. machines will partner and co-operate with humans.    according to the professor at the university of washington, he explained that, as a result of ai, there will be more demand for existing jobs and new jobs will be created that are unimaginable today. human workers and machines will work together flawlessly, complementing each other. machines will learn to carry out easier tasks such as following processes or crunching data. they will also help the humans while difficult. machines or ai will create a great job opportunities for humans in future. john kelly ll, executive vice president of ibm once said that “man and machines working together always beat or make a better decision than a man or a machine independently.”     in future, the three sectors of our country like agriculture sector, industrial sector and service sector are going to utilize the machines. so, that their work becomes not difficult. as of now, we can only see that for agriculture purposes various kinds of machines are used which we called as a modern farming method. some major technologies [machines] that are harvest automation, autonomous tractors, seeding, and weeing and drones. as a result, farms can do agriculture peacefully. in the industrial sector also humans and machines are working together to increase production. various types of machines are used in industries such as packing machines, loading machine etc. humans provide instructions to the machines and maintain the management in the company. soon robots [machines] will assist doctors with surgeries. for instance, a doctor at remote location could direct a surgical robot to perform an open heart surgery. but the approaches option and decision will be left to experience and wisdom of the doctor not the robot.    what do you think of machines if they will make humans less or more in the field? machines will push human professionals up the skillset ladder into uniquely human skills such as creativity, social abilities, empathy, and sense-making, which machines cannot automate. as a result, machines will make the workplace more, not less for humans. however, humans have to learn new skills throughout their lives. it is said that in the future 80% of process-oriented tasks will be done by machines. quantitative reasoning tasks will be done approximately 50% by humans and 50% by machines, while humans will continue to do more than 80% of cross-functional reasoning tasks. according to harvard research machines, algorithms can read diagnostic scans with 92% accuracy. humans can do it with 96% accuracy. together, it will be 99% accurate.    human-machine collaboration enables companies to interact with employees and customers in the novel, more effective ways. smart machines are helping humans to expand their abilities in three ways. they can amplify our cognitive strengths; interact with customers and employees to free us from higher-level tasks, and embody human skills to extend our physical capabilities. in the research, it was found that 1,500 companies achieve the most significant performance improvement when humans and machines work together. new machine systems have beyond-human cognitive abilities, which many of us fear could potentially dehumanize the future of work. machines will indeed automate most repetitive and physical tasks, and part of quantitative tasks such as programming and even data science. according to d.e shaw group and professor at the university of washington, explained that, as a result of machines, there will be more demand for existing jobs, and new jobs will be created that are unimaginable today. this is similar to how we couldn’t imagine a web app developer decades ago, and now millions make a living doing that today.    machines are good at doing tasks with speed, precision, and accuracy. but machines are not very good at responding to unknown situations or making judgments. that part will be left to humans. hence, the need for both humans and machines will be there in the future. humans and machines have divergent skill sets that, when combined can transform the way we work. machines have already infiltrated every aspect of our lives, and we must learn to live with them. in the future, human workers will interact more closely with humans.",28,12,0.39999999000000025,0.09950248756218906,3.9411764705882355,0.032060156511854974,1.5892946508400363,12.8881829177657,402,2.671641791044776,2,6.718905472636816
12129.8,"machine learning techniques may have been used for years, but recently there has been an explosion in their applications. in fact, in a recent q3 earnings call, google ceo sundar pichai said “machine learning is a core, transformative way by which we’re re-thinking how we’re doing everything.” and they’re far from the only business making that claim.    in the past, successful use of machine learning algorithms required bespoke algorithms and huge r&d budgets, but all that is changing. ibm watson, microsoft azure, amazon, and alibaba all launched turnkey cloud-based machine-learning saas solutions in 2015. at the same time startups like idibon, metamind, dato, and monkeylearn have built machine learning products that companies can take advantage of.    gartner already puts machine learning at the top of its hype curve, and no: machine learning won’t replace all of your employees with computers or suddenly double your revenue. but that doesn’t mean that it can’t give every business a competitive advantage. there are plenty of business processes that can significantly benefit from machine learning. so how does machine learning change the way businesses operate?    fig: machine learning techniques for business    bigger upfront costs    first thing’s first: machine learning needs training data and training data costs money. especially training data labeled by humans. let me explain. to make machine learning work for business, the algorithm needs to see lots and lots of examples of what it’s supposed to be doing. if you want an algorithm to tell you if a sales lead is good, you need to show it lots and lots of examples of good sales leads and bad sales leads. if you want an algorithm to tag the support tickets you need to show it many examples of support tickets. if you localize your algorithm to a new language you probably need to collect lots of examples in that language. in some instances, a company may have those training sets in-house. for example, a bunch of disqualified or qualified leads. but say you haven’t labeled each of your support tickets as they’ve come in over the year. you’d need to have people either in-house or en masse via a data enrichment platform -label those tickets. the machine will then look at those judgments and start finding connections and patterns it can learn from.    much lower ongoing costs    machine learning is much cheaper and more efficient than people when it works well. the downside is that it often works well in 80 percent of the cases and badly in 20 percent of the cases, and lowering the 20 percent error rate is hard, if not impossible. but even an 80 percent accurate algorithm can save you a lot of money because good machine learning algorithms know where they are accurate and where they are more likely to have errors. smart companies take the cases where the algorithm has high confidence and uses those directly while sending low confidence cases to humans. banks have been doing this for years. when you put a check in an atm, an algorithm tries to decipher the numbers on the check. if you have really sloppy handwriting or the ink is smudged the algorithm passes the task to a human. this design pattern saves banks lots of money while preserving a very high level of accuracy.    your costs will drop over time    a huge benefit of machine learning is that it can turn part of your variable cost into more of a fixed cost. if you use humans to handle cases where that algorithm is struggling, you are creating the perfect training data to feed into your algorithm. this is a well-studied technique called active learning it turns out that training data labels collected on cases where the algorithm has low confidence help the algorithm learn much, much more efficiently.    as the algorithm becomes increasingly more accurate, the unit economics of your business process become better and as machine learning becomes able to handle more cases, the expensive humans are only called in on the toughest, rarest situations. that means you use the best of both human and machine intelligence in tandem: leveraging the speed and reliability of computers for the easy judgments and the fluency and expertise of humans for the difficult ones. and if that sounds like smart business, it’s because it is.",44,14,0.5172413703923902,0.1475826972010178,3.8529411764705883,0.01748735809737544,1.5481714138271856,6.8725317322685475,393,2.4427480916030535,0,6.325699745547074
123.0,"telemedicine, the use of technology to diagnose and treat patients remotely, has been rising in recent years. with the advent of high-speed internet and improved video conferencing tools, healthcare providers are increasingly turning to telemedicine to provide care to patients in remote or underserved areas.    telemedicine, using technology to provide healthcare services remotely, has recently gained popularity. with advancements in communication and medical technology, it has become increasingly possible for doctors and patients to connect and interact from anywhere in the world. this has led to the rise of telemedicine, which has the potential to revolutionize the way healthcare is delivered.#telemedicine    the increasing focus on preventative healthcare has also driven the rise of telemedicine. as more and more people become aware of the importance of staying healthy, they are looking for ways to prevent illness and maintain their health. telemedicine allows people to monitor their health and get advice from healthcare providers without traveling to a clinic or hospital.    improved access to healthcare: one of the biggest challenges in the healthcare industry is the unequal distribution of medical resources, with many remote and rural areas lacking access to quality care. telemedicine can help bridge this gap by allowing patients in these underserved areas to connect with healthcare providers worldwide. this can give people access to specialized medical care that they would otherwise not be able to receive, improving their health and overall well-being.#healthcare    greater convenience and flexibility: telemedicine also offers a level of convenience and flexibility that is impossible with traditional in-person medical visits. patients can consult with their healthcare providers from the comfort of their own homes, saving time and money on travel. this is particularly beneficial for individuals who have mobility issues or who live in areas with limited access to medical facilities.    reduced healthcare costs: by enabling patients to receive care remotely, telemedicine can help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. this is because telemedicine visits are generally less expensive than in-person visits and can help prevent the need for more costly interventions, such as hospitalizations. as a result, telemedicine has the potential to make healthcare more affordable for patients and healthcare providers alike.#costs    enhanced healthcare outcomes: telemedicine can also improve patients’ quality of care. by allowing healthcare providers to access medical records and other important information remotely, telemedicine can help ensure that patients receive the most appropriate care for their needs. this can lead to better health outcomes and a higher quality of life for patients.#enhanced    more significant job opportunities in the healthcare industry like healthcare sector, including for healthcare providers, support staff, and technology experts. this can provide a boost to local economies and help to reduce unemployment.#jobs    better care for chronic conditions: telemedicine can help patients with chronic conditions to manage their health more effectively, allowing them to receive regular check-ups and treatment without the need to travel long distances. this can improve the quality of life for these individuals and reduce the risk of complications from their conditions.    increased flexibility for patients and healthcare providers: telemedicine allows patients and providers to schedule consultations at times convenient for them, improving the overall flexibility of the healthcare system. this can help to reduce wait times and improve patient satisfaction.    increased accessibility: telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible to people living in rural and remote areas, who may not have easy access to medical facilities. with telemedicine, patients can consult with doctors and specialists from their homes using their phones, computers, or other devices. this means that more people will be able to get the medical care they need, regardless of where they live.    reduced costs: one of the most significant benefits of telemedicine is that it can reduce healthcare costs. patients can avoid the costs of travel, accommodation, and time off work associated with in-person visits to the doctor. telemedicine can also help reduce the cost of medical procedures, as doctors can remotely monitor patients and provide care without needing hospitalization.    improved health outcomes: by providing patients with access to medical care from the comfort of their own homes, telemedicine can help improve their health outcomes. for example, patients with chronic conditions can use telemedicine to manage their symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. telemedicine can also help prevent the spread of infectious diseases, as patients can receive care without contacting other people.    increased convenience: telemedicine offers a more convenient option for patients who need medical care. with telemedicine, patients can schedule appointments and consult with doctors at a convenient time without having to take time off work or arrange transportation. this can be especially beneficial for people with busy schedules or mobility issues.    telemedicine, or the use of electronic communication and information technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, has the potential to significantly impact the way we receive and deliver medical care. in the next 20 years, telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of our healthcare system, providing numerous benefits and improving the livelihood of many people.    the benefits of telemedicine are numerous. for patients, it provides convenient access to medical care without traveling long distances. it also allows for faster diagnosis and treatment and improved continuity of care. for healthcare providers, telemedicine can reduce the strain on already-overburdened healthcare systems and make providing care to patients in remote areas more accessible.    the rise of telemedicine will likely significantly impact how we receive medical care in the future. by 2040, it is estimated that telemedicine will be a standard part of the healthcare landscape, with more and more doctors using it to diagnose and treat patients remotely.    one of the key drivers of the rise of telemedicine has been the increasing availability of high-speed internet and improved video conferencing tools. in the past, the video and audio quality of telemedicine consultations were often poor, making it difficult for doctors to diagnose and treat patients accurately. however, with faster internet speeds and better video conferencing tools, telemedicine consultations are just as good as in-person visits.    telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible. with telemedicine, patients no longer travel long distances to see a doctor or specialist. instead, they can receive care from the comfort of their own home. this is particularly beneficial for people living in rural areas, where access to healthcare can be limited.    another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the increasing demand for healthcare services. with the global population growing and people living longer, the need for medical care will only continue to increase. telemedicine offers a way for healthcare providers to meet this demand by allowing them to provide care to more patients in a shorter amount of time.    another substantial impact of telemedicine is that it can improve patient quality of care. by using technology to connect patients with doctors, telemedicine can help ensure patients receive the best care possible. for example, a doctor can use video conferencing to consult with a specialist or use remote monitoring devices to track a patient’s vital signs. this can help doctors make more informed decisions and provide better treatment.    telemedicine also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs. by allowing patients to receive care from their homes, telemedicine can reduce the need for expensive hospital visits. in addition, telemedicine can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases, reducing healthcare costs by avoiding hospitalization.    one of the critical impacts of telemedicine is that it can improve the patient experience. by providing patients with the ability to receive care from the comfort of their own homes, telemedicine can help reduce anxiety and stress. in addition, telemedicine can make it easier for patients to communicate with their doctors and get the answers they need.    another way in which telemedicine will impact people’s livelihoods is by making healthcare more efficient. by allowing doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely, telemedicine will help reduce the time patients spend waiting to see a doctor. it will also help reduce doctors’ spending on administrative tasks, freeing them up to see more patients and provide better care.    one major factor driving the rise of telemedicine is the increasing use of technology in healthcare. with advances in communication and medical technology, it is now possible for doctors and other healthcare providers to remotely diagnose and treat patients using video conferencing, remote monitoring, and other forms of telemedicine. this not only allows for more efficient and convenient healthcare delivery but also enables healthcare providers to offer specialized care to patients who otherwise may not have access to it.    another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the need for improved access to healthcare. patients may travel long distances in many rural and underserved areas; patients may travel long distances to access medical care. telemedicine can bridge this gap by allowing patients in these areas to consult with healthcare providers remotely. this not only improves access to healthcare but also reduces the need for patients to travel long distances, saving them time and money.    finally, telemedicine’s rise is also driven by the growing trend of remote work. as more and more people work from home or other remote locations, the need for convenient and accessible healthcare is increasing. telemedicine allows employees to consult with healthcare providers from their homes, reducing the need for them to take time off work to visit a doctor or other healthcare provider.    overall, the rise of telemedicine by 2040 is a result of a combination of factors, including the increasing use of technology in healthcare, the need for improved access to healthcare, and the growing trend of remote work. as these factors continue to evolve, likely, telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of the healthcare landscape.    however, the rise of telemedicine is also likely to present some challenges. for example, telemedicine consultations may only be suitable for some medical conditions, and some patients may still need to see a doctor. additionally, telemedicine may put some jobs at risk, such as receptionists and other administrative staff in healthcare facilities.",89,24,0.5752212338475997,0.11368209255533199,9.745098039215685,0.18944637938823394,3.9738177674415684,188.30970111190453,994,3.056338028169014,0,7.338028169014085
12591.6,"elearning as technology becomes more affordable in higher education but having a big barrier in the cost of developing its resources. deep learning using artificial intelligence continues to become more and more popular and having impacts on many areas of elearning. it offers online learners of the future intuitive algorithms and automated delivery of elearning content through modern lms platforms. this paper aims to survey various applications of deep learning approaches for developing the resources of the elearning platform, in which predictions, algorithms, and analytics come together to create more personalized future elearning experiences. in addition, deep learning models for developing the contents of the elearning platform, deep learning framework that enable deep learning systems into elearning and its development, benefits & future trends of deep learning in elearning, the relevant deep learning-based artificial intelligence tools, and a platform enabling the developer and learners to quickly reuse resources are clearly summarized. thus, deep learning has evolved into developing ways to re-purpose existing resources that can mitigate the expense of content development of future elearning.    it is natural to wonder where you might get ai tools to avoid the time and expense of developing your own. don’t worry about the advert of aiaas or “ai as a service” even small education or learning & development professionals can purchase the license of ai tools and components. however, such types of tools cannot be useful for every e-learning ecosystem but may offer some enticing benefits such as adding standard ai tasks (logic, decision making) to your toolbox. here are some of the aiaas tools and platforms offered by famous tech giants most of which are cloud-based.    microsoft azure    cloud-based ai services that can be used to build and manage ai applications like image recognition or bot-based apps    ibm’s watson    cloud-based ai services that can be integrated into your applications; to store and manage your own data    google’s tensor flow     an end-to-end open-source machine learning platform    amazon web services    offers a wide range of products and services on amazon’s cloud    there are other aiaas platforms such as datarobot, petuum, and h2o which shows that the field is expanding.ai will probably not make human workers obsolete, at least not for a long time to put some of your fears to bed: the robots are probably not coming for your jobs, at least not yet. given how artificial intelligence has been portrayed in the media, in particular in some of our favorite sci-fi movies, it’s clear that the advent of this technology has created fear that ai will one day make human beings obsolete in the workforce. after all, as technology has advanced, many tasks that were once executed by human hands have become automated. it’s only natural to fear that the leap toward creating intelligent computers could herald the beginning of the end of work as we know it. but, i don’t think there is any reason to be so fatalistic. a recent paper published by the mit task force on the work of the future entitled “artificial intelligence and the future of work,” looked closely at developments in ai and their relation to the world of work. the paper paints a more optimistic picture.    rather than promoting the obsolescence of human labor, the paper predicts that ai will continue to drive massive innovation that will fuel many existing industries and could have the potential to create many new sectors for growth, ultimately leading to the creation of more jobs. while ai has made major strides toward replicating the efficacy of human intelligence in executing certain tasks, there are still major limitations. in particular, ai programs are typically only capable of “specialized” intelligence, meaning they can solve only one problem, and execute only one task at a time. often, they can be rigid, and unable to respond to any changes in input, or perform any “thinking” outside of their prescribed programming. humans, however, possess “generalized intelligence,” with the kind of problem-solving, abstract thinking, and critical judgment that will continue to be important in business. human judgment will be relevant, if not in every task, then certainly throughout every level across all sectors. there are many other factors that could limit runaway advancement in ai. ai often requires “learning” which can involve massive amounts of data, calling into question the availability of the right kind of data, and highlighting the need for categorization and issues of privacy and security around such data. there is also the limitation of computation and processing power. the cost of electricity alone to power one supercharged language model ai was estimated at $4.6 million. another important limitation of note is that data can itself carry bias, and be reflective of societal inequities or the implicit biases of the designers who create and input the data. if there is bias in the data that is inputted into an ai, this bias is likely to carry over to the results generated by the ai.    there has even been a bill introduced into congress entitled the algorithmic accountability act with the goal of forcing the federal trade commission to investigate the use of any new ai technology for the potential to perpetuate bias. based on these factors and many others, the mit cci paper argues that we are a long way from reaching a point in which ai is comparable to human intelligence, and could theoretically replace human workers entirely.  provided there is an investment at all levels, from education to the private sector and governmental organizations—anywhere that focuses on training and upskilling workers—ai has the potential to ultimately create more jobs, not less. the question should then become not “humans or computers” but “humans and computers” involved in complex systems that advance industry and prosperity. this paper is a fascinating read for anyone hoping to dive deeper into ai and the many potential directions in which it may lead.ai is becoming standard in all businesses, not just in the world of tech a couple of times recently, ai has come up in conversation with a client or an associate, and i’m noticing a fallacy in how people are thinking about it. there seems to be a sense for many that it is a phenomenon that is only likely to have big impacts in the tech world. in case you hadn’t noticed, the tech world is the world these days. don’t ever forget when economist paul krugman said in 1998 that “by 2005 or so, it will become clear that the internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.” you definitely don’t want to be behind the curve when it comes to ai.  in fact, 90% of leading businesses already have ongoing investments in ai technologies. more than half of businesses that have implemented some manner of ai-driven technology report experiencing greater productivity. ai is likely to have a strong impact on certain sectors in particular:    medical:    the potential benefits of utilizing ai in the field of medicine are already being explored. the medical industry has a robust amount of data, which can be utilized to create predictive models related to healthcare. additionally, ai has shown to be more effective than physicians in certain diagnostic contexts.    automotive:    we’re already seeing how ai is impacting the world of transportation and automobiles with the advent of autonomous vehicles and autonomous navigation. ai will also have a major impact on manufacturing, including within the automotive sector.    cybersecurity:    cybersecurity is front of mind for many business leaders, especially considering the spike in cybersecurity breaches throughout 2020. attacks rose 600% during the pandemic as hackers capitalized on people working from home, on less secure technological systems, and wi-fi networks. ai and machine learning will be critical tools in identifying and predicting threats in cybersecurity. ai will also be a crucial asset for security in the world of finance, given that it can process large amounts of data to predict and catch instances of fraud.    e-commerce:    ai will play a pivotal role in e-commerce in the future, in every sector of the industry from user experience to marketing to fulfillment and distribution. we can expect that moving forward, ai will continue to drive e-commerce, including through the use of chat-bots, shopper personalization, image-based targeting advertising, and warehouse and inventory automation.    ai can have a big impact on the job search    if you are moving forward with the hope that a hiring manager may give you the benefit of the doubt on a small misstep within the application, you might be in for a rude awakening. ai already plays a major role in the hiring process, so much so that up to 75% of resumes are rejected by an automated applicant tracking system, or ats before they even reach a human being.  in the past, recruiters have had to devote considerable time to poring over resumes to look for relevant candidates. data from linkedin shows that recruiters can spend up to 23 hours looking over resumes for one successful hire.    increasingly, however, resume scanning is being done by ai-powered programs. in 2018, 67% of hiring managers stated that ai was making their jobs easier. despite the increasing prevalence of automation and algorithms in the hiring process, many have been critical of the use of certain types of ai by hiring managers, based on the charge that it can perpetuate and ever create more bias in hiring. one particular example is illustrated by hirevue, a startup whose initial services included technology that aimed to use facial recognition software and psychology to determine the potential effectiveness of a candidate in a certain role. the electronic privacy information center filed a lawsuit with the federal trade commission alleging that this software had the potential to perpetuate bias and prejudice. hirevue discontinued the use of facial recognition software in early 2021, and now uses audio analysis and natural language processing. it’s clear that the use of certain types of ai in the hiring process will likely be controversial as new technology develops. however, if potential employers are using ai to process your application, there is no reason that you cannot be utilizing similar technology to your advantage.    jobscan is an excellent resource that provides similar resume scanning to what would be used by a hiring manager. by comparing your resume to a job description, jobscan will give you information on how to tweak your resume so that it is a good match for a certain position, with the goal of “beating” an applicant tracking system (ats).    jobseer is a browser add-on, and another great ai-based tool for those on the job market. based on a scan of your resume, as well as keywords and skills related to your desired jobs, jobseer will help match you with the job listings that best fit your experience. for each listing, you get a rating based on how well you are aligned with the particular posting, as well as recommendations of skills to add to better position your resume and experience.    rezi: now, as a disclaimer, i would never encourage you to turn your resume writing over to a bot. but rezi is an awesome ai-based resume builder that includes templates to help you design a resume that is sure to check the boxes when it comes to applicant tracking systems. this is a great jumping-off point to kickstart a new resume.  another great way to use this type of tool is to generate a new resume and compare it to your current resume to see how it stacks up, and identify some areas for improvement. ai is also a great place to focus your energy if you are looking to upskill in your career, or make your professional profile more competitive in the job market, especially when you consider that ai will have such far-reaching impacts across many industries.ai and machine learning are at the top of many lists of the most important skills in today’s job market. jobs requesting ai or machine-learning skills are expected to increase by 71% in the next five years. if you’d like to expand your knowledge base in this arena, consider some of the great free online course offerings that focus on ai skills. if you are tech-savvy, it would be wise to dive deep and learn as much as you can about interacting in the ai space. if your skills lie elsewhere, it is important to recognize that ai will have a big impact, and to the extent of your abilities, you should try to understand the fundamentals of how it functions in different sectors. ai is definitely here to stay, whether we like it or not. personally, i don’t think we have anything to be afraid of. the best way to move forward is to be aware of and adapt to the new technology around us, ai included. this article was updated on april 16, 2021, to reflect changes in

13053.4,"before the internet, information was in some ways restricted and more centralized. the only mediums of information were books, newspapers, and word of mouth, etc. but now with the advent of the internet and improvements to computer technology (moore’s law), information and data skyrocketed, and it has become this open-system, where information can be distributed to people without any kind of limits.    securing your devices and networks    encrypt your data    various publicly available tools have taken the rocket science out of encrypting (and decrypting) email and files. data encryption isn’t just for technology geeks; modern tools make it possible for anyone to encrypt emails and other information. “encryption used to be the sole province of geeks and mathematicians, but a lot has changed in recent years. in particular, various publicly available tools have taken the rocket science out of encrypting (and decrypting) email and files. gpg for mail, for example, is an open-source plug-in for the apple mail program that makes it easy to encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify emails using the openpgp standard. and for protecting files, newer versions of apple’s os x operating system come with filevault, a program that encrypts the hard drive of a computer. those running microsoft windows have a similar program. this software will scramble your data, but won’t protect you from government authorities demanding your encryption key under the regulation of investigatory powers act (2000), which is why some aficionados recommend truecrypt, a program with some very interesting facilities, which might have been useful to david miranda,” explains john naughton in an article for the guardian.    backup your data    one of the most basic, yet often overlooked, data protection tips is backing up your data. basically, this creates a duplicate copy of your data so that if a device is lost, stolen, or compromised, you don’t also lose your important information. as the u.s. chamber of commerce and insurance company nationwide points out, “according to nationwide, 68% of small businesses don’t have a disaster recovery plan. the problem with this is the longer it takes you to restore your data, the more money you’ll lose. gartner found that this downtime can cost companies as much as $300,000 an hour.”     the cloud provides a viable backup option    while you should use sound security practices when you’re making use of the cloud, it can provide an ideal solution for backing up your data. since data is not stored on a local device, it’s easily accessible even when your hardware becomes compromised. “cloud storage, where data is kept offsite by a provider, is a guarantee of adequate disaster recovery,” according to this post on techradar. twitter: @techradar    anti-malware protection is a must.    scammers are sneaky: sometimes malware is cleverly disguised as an email from a friend or a useful website. malware is a serious issue plaguing many computer users, and it’s known for cropping up in inconspicuous places, unbeknownst to users. anti-malware protection is essential for laying a foundation of security for your devices. “malware (short for malicious software) is software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer without your consent. malware includes computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, spyware, scareware, and more. it can be present on websites and emails or hidden in downloadable files, photos, videos, freeware, or shareware. (however, it should be noted that most websites, shareware, or freeware applications do not come with malware.) the best way to avoid getting infected is to run a good anti-virus protection program, do periodic scans for spyware, avoid clicking on suspicious email links or websites. but scammers are sneaky: sometimes malware is cleverly disguised as an email from a friend or a useful website. even the most cautious of web-surfers will likely pick up an infection at some point.,” explains clark howard. twitter: @clarkhoward    fig: protect your computer from viruses    make your old computers’ hard drives unreadable.    much information can be gleaned through old computing devices, but you can protect your personal data by making hard drives unreadable before disposing of them. “make old computers’ hard drives unreadable. after you back up your data and transfer the files elsewhere, you should sanitize by disk shredding, magnetically cleaning the disk, or using software to wipe the disk clean. destroy old computer disks and backup tapes,” according to the florida office of the attorney general. twitter: @agpambondi    install operating system updates.    operating system updates are a gigantic pain for users; it’s the honest truth. but they’re a necessary evil, as these updates contain critical security patches that will protect your computer from recently discovered threats. failing to install these updates means your computer is at risk. “no matter which operating system you use, it’s important that you update it regularly. windows operating systems are typically updated at least monthly, typically on so-called ‘patch tuesday.’ other operating systems may not be updated quite as frequently or on a regular schedule. it’s best to set your operating system to update automatically. the method for doing so will vary depending upon your particular operating system,” says privacyrights.org. twitter: @privacytoday    automate your software updates.    many software programs will automatically connect and update to defend against known risks.    in order to ensure that you’re downloading the latest security updates from operating systems and other software, enable automatic updates. “many software programs will automatically connect and update to defend against known risks. turn on automatic updates if that’s an available option,” suggests staysafeonline.org. twitter: @staysafeonline    secure your wireless network at your home or business.    a valuable tip for both small business owners and individuals or families, it’s always recommended to secure your wireless network with a password. this prevents unauthorized individuals within proximity to hijack your wireless network. even if they’re merely attempting to get free wi-fi access, you don’t want to inadvertently share private information with other people who are using your network without permission. “if you have a wi-fi network for your workplace, make sure it is secure, encrypted, and hidden. to hide your wi-fi network, set up your wireless access point or router so it does not broadcast the network name, known as the service set identifier (ssid). password protect access to the router,” says fcc.gov in an article offering data protection tips for small businesses. twitter: @fcc    turn off your computer.    when you’re finished using your computer or laptop, power it off. leaving computing devices on, and most often, connected to the internet, opens the door for rogue attacks. “leaving your computer connected to the internet when it’s not in use gives scammers 24/7 access to install malware and commit cybercrimes. to be safe, turn off your computer when it’s not in use,” suggests csid, a division of experian. twitter: @experianps_na        fig: to avoid from hacking turn off your computer    use a firewall.    firewalls assist in blocking dangerous programs, viruses, or spyware before they infiltrate your system.”firewalls assist in blocking dangerous programs, viruses, or spyware before they infiltrate your system. various software companies offer firewall protection, but hardware-based firewalls, like those frequently built into network routers, provide a better level of security,” says geek squad. twitter: @geeksquad    practice the principle of least privilege (polp).    indiana university information technology recommends following the principle of least privilege (polp): “do not log into a computer with administrator rights unless you must do so to perform specific tasks. running your computer as an administrator (or as a power user in windows) leaves your computer vulnerable to security risks and exploits. simply visiting an unfamiliar internet site with these high-privilege accounts can cause extreme damage to your computer, such as reformatting your hard drive, deleting all your files, and creating a new user account with administrative access. when you do need to perform tasks as an administrator, always follow security procedures.” twitter: @indianauniv    use “passphrases” rather than “passwords.”    what’s the difference? “…we recommend you use passphrases–a series of random words or a sentence. the more characters your passphrase has, the stronger it is.  the advantage is these are much easier to remember and type, but still hard for cyber attackers to hack.” explains sans. twitter: @sansawareness    encrypt data on your usb drives and sim cards.    encrypt your sim card in case your phone is ever stolen, or take it out if you are selling your old cell phone. encrypting your data on your removable storage devices can make it more difficult (albeit not impossible) for criminals to interpret your personal data should your device become lost or stolen. usb drives and sim cards are excellent examples of removable storage devices that can simply be plugged into another device, enabling the user to access all the data stored on it. unless, of course, it’s encrypted. “your usb drive could easily be stolen and put into another computer, where they can steal all of your files and even install malware or viruses onto your flash drive that will infect any computer it is plugged in to. encrypt your sim card in case your phone is ever stolen, or take it out if you are selling your old cell phone,” according to mike juba in an article on business2community. twitter: @ezsolutioncorp    don’t store passwords with your laptop or mobile device.    a post-it note stuck to the outside of your laptop or tablet is “akin to leaving your keys in your car,” says the ohio state university’s office of the chief information officer. likewise, you shouldn’t leave your laptop in your car. it’s a magnet for identity thieves. twitter: @ohiostate        fig: media sharing    disable file and media sharing if you don’t need it.    if you don’t really need your files to be visible to other machines, disable file and media sharing completely. if you have a home wireless network with multiple devices connected, you might find it convenient to share files between machines. however, there’s no reason to make files publicly available if it’s not necessary. “make sure that you share some of your folders only on the home network. if you don’t really need your files to be visible to other machines, disable file and media sharing completely,” says kaspersky. twitter: @kaspersky    create encrypted volumes for portable, private data files.    howtogeek offers a series of articles with tips, tricks, and tools for encrypting files or sets of files using various programs and tools. this article covers a method for creating an encrypted volume to easily transport private, sensitive data for access on multiple computers. twitter: @howtogeeksite    overwrite deleted files.    deleting your information on a computing device rarely means it’s truly deleted permanently. often, this data still exists on disk and can be recovered by someone who knows what they’re doing (such as, say, a savvy criminal determined to find your personal information). the only way to really ensure that your old data is gone forever is to overwrite it. luckily, there are tools to streamline this process. pcworld covers a tool and process for overwriting old data on windows operating systems. twitter: @pcworld    don’t forget to delete old files from cloud backups.    if you back up your files to the cloud, remember that even though you delete them on your computer or mobile device, they’re still stored in your cloud account. if you’re diligent about backing up your data and use a secure cloud storage service to do so, you’re headed in the right direction. that said, cloud backups, and any data backups really, create an added step when it comes to deleting old information. don’t forget to delete files from your backup services in addition to those you remove (or overwrite) on your local devices. “if you back up your files to the cloud, remember that even though you delete them on your computer or mobile device, they’re still stored in your cloud account. to completely delete the file, you’ll also need to remove it from your backup cloud account,” says re/code. twitter:

13515.2,"we all hear day in and day out that we amidst a technological revolution. but do we know what this really means?    before we understand how its going to impact us, let us first discuss what these terms really mean.    a technological revolution simply means that we are in a period where better and newer technologies replace the others to get the job done faster and better. we are in an era with rapid innovations where machines are being compared to humans.        fig: technological revolution    so, then what is machine learning?    machine learning is basically the application of artificial intelligence into electronic systems to enable them to learn and enhance themselves without being programmed by humans. it is the evolution and development of computer programs that can access data and then use it to advance themselves. whether you know it or not, you use machine learning-powered applications daily.    now, what is artificial intelligence?    at its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving.     in simple words, artificial intelligence is the technology that facilitates these machines to perform human like behaviour.    just like every other industry, machine learning is playing its role in the finance and banking industry too. in most cases where a human would perform the same task by performing the same calculations or following the same process can be taught to the machine which can now perform it by itself.    let us discuss a few examples of the applications that we might have come in our day to day running which are a result of machine learning in this industry:    portfolio managementrisk underwritingalgorithmic tradingfraud detectionprocess automationcustomer onboardingcustomer churndecision makingprocess automation    portfolio management    in earlier days, an investor would need to consult a financial advisor to understand his/her risk appetite and advise accordingly. today, using machine learning algorithms there exists the concept of a “robo-advisor” that requires any user to give certain inputs about their financial status and goals and calculates their risk tolerance and constructs and idle portfolio allocation for them. young users today find this extremely useful rather than physically visiting an advisor and paying a fee for doing so.    risk underwriting    underwriting is one of the core functions for most financial institutions especially banks and insurance companies where they are required to underwrite the risk of the customers before loaning out money or insurance policies. these underwriting activities are based on trends and thumb rules industrywide. the same has been introduced through machine learning which is able to underwrite risks today on a larger and more accurate scale.    algorithmic trading    machine learning is a mathematical model that tracks market information, analyses massive data sources and study market conditions simultaneously to detect patterns which can be used for trading. this is humanly impossible to do in a fraction of time. algorithmic systems can make millions of trades daily, often known as “high-frequency trading”. it is highly believed that deep learning is playing its role in calibrating real-time trading decisions.    fraud detection    with the increase in use and dependency on computers for financial transactions came the data security risk. there is an ample amount of valuable data stored online available to create potential risk. machine learning thus helped in fraud detection by detecting anomalies in transactions and flagging them for scrutiny based on the risk factors defined by the institutions. fraud identification in insurance claims, credit card payments, identity theft, account theft, are all areas in fraud detection that machine learning can help in.    process automation    process automation is one of the most common applications of machine learning in finance. the technology has helped in replacing manual work, automate repetitive tasks to avoid redundancy, and as a result, increase productivity. machine learning has benefitted these organizations to optimize costs, improve customer experiences, and scale up their services. some examples of financial and banking firms using process automation are the use of chatbots, automated calls, paperwork automation, and gamified employee training.    customer onboarding    in this highly competitive industry, customer acquisition and the customer onboarding process is highly relevant in building a good customer relationship. at any stage, during the onboarding, a slight inconvenience or delay can act as a barrier. machine learning-enabled complete automation in this process for these financial and banking institutions. today, from opening an account, filing for any application can be completed within a few minutes with utmost ease. with ai, customers’ behavioral patterns have been studied to improvise and make the whole process efficient and user-friendly.    customer churn    with the multitude of offerings and availability of a plethora of options, customer stickiness is a big problem faced by financial firms. customer churn forecasting is one of the best big data use cases. it helps in detecting customers who cancel their subscription and analyses the same to tailor products as per customer needs. video streaming application, netflix’s subscribers worldwide has continued to grow to reach 167 million through using machine learning analytics on their customer database.    decision making    financial and banking institutions function on facilitating investments made by their customers. organizations are constantly in search of customers from whom they can get more revenue. this is now possible through performing machine learning analysis on both structured and unstructured data which helps them make more informed decisions. it also analyses data from the website and mobile application to construct effective marketing campaigns for the targeted customers.    future of machine learning in finance    financial monitoring, security analysis, prevention of money laundering, network security, investment predictions, personalization of customer service everything comes under the realm of the applications of machine learning in the financial and banking industry. yet, this is just the tip of the iceberg, there is a lot more that is going to change in the future. it is now visibly imperative that while ai is beginning to create a wave of transformation across these industries and adapting to these changes s important for one’s survival. with smart technology applied everywhere, all financial firms are bound to turn into fintech’s to stay relevant to the “silver tech generation” consisting of millennials and the genzs.    final thoughts    the financial services industry has entered the space of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the pace is not surprising knowing the positive changes it has brought. machine learning has the most use cases in finance than any other industry because of the available computer power and new machine learning tools. the greatest applications include simplifying customer engagement and accurate sales forecasting. it is only making this industry better and more efficient with each new adaptation. machine learning algorithms have the capability to deal with a lot more than human capacity along with eliminating human error. as even the algorithms are constantly learning and innovating, they can serve as a bridge to a completely flawless automated financial system in the future. nonetheless, the challenges of high cost and lack of resources that come along play a significant role in how early these firms can adopt these technologies. but even then, the future seems bright as the industry has enough adopters and prospects ready to

13977.0,"it’s the year 2060. an automaton in a research laboratory says to a scientist, “warning! error occurred reformatting hard disk now!” the scientist panics. automaton says again,” ha! ha! just kidding! “.    funny right. before some of you say that this joke isn’t realistic, “how can an automaton tell you a joke?” but what if i tell you in 2017, “sofia” the robot made a joke on the show good morning britain! who thought computers could tell us a joke? hard to believe? well, the idea of giving computers human-enjoy thinking has now become a reality. thanks to the technological advancement in ai in the last decade.    before diving deep into how ai can impact the future of work, let’s begin with the simple question: what’s ai? artificial intelligence provides machines the power to think from data. the machine uses the patterns and trends found in data and makes its decision, but cannot create thought beyond these patterns and trends.    fig: impact of robots on employments    with the rise of ai, humans are divided into one question. are machines human’s friend or foe? tech executives and politicians on conference stages, campaign rallies, and even science fiction hollywood movies like carbon black, westworld, minority report, and ex machina have given their take on this question. some believe ai will help us solve problems while others believe that the rise of ai will result in destruction and maybe the end of the world, we all know.    stephen hawking made it no secret of his concern about the rise of superhuman ai that eventually would escape earth to a new planet. no, this isn’t a plot of black mirror. right now, superhumans may not be a reality, but ai is.    “homo deus”, the emergence of the new digital god using ai. god must also worry, as ai might take his job.    here’s some career advice, have you thought about being a robot? the fear that ai would automate all jobs in the future eventually leaving all humans jobless has been daunting for many workers today. statistics show that nearly 37% of workers worry about losing their jobs to robots. while another thought that many people believe is that though the rise of ai with result in automating most of the jobs in the future, however, it also will create millions of new job opportunities.    ai is already replacing most manual and repetitive tasks. for example, buying a metro ticket or a movie ticket is now almost a human-less interaction. each year the number of industrial robot jobs increases by 14 %. at this rate, it’s predicted that the 20 million jobs in the manufacturing industry will be replaced by robots due to automation.    the coronavirus pandemic and recession have boosted the demand for automation. the robotic process automation (rpa) software industry has experienced an increase of 19.53% in the year 2021. coronavirus pandemic has increased interest in technology that reduces human contact as minimal for making workplaces safe.    our workplaces will look much different in the next five to ten years. ai will help humans in simplifying repetitive processes. the two most important catalysts for the future of work are the two d’s- digitization and datafication. digitalization is converting data to digital formats (computer-readable). for example, text to html, analog video to youtube video. digitization helps in increasing data exponentially. datafication is quantifying human life to data and improving the data-driven business model. by 2025, it is forecasted that the digital transformation space will build in a $3,294 billion industry!    one thing is clear, no data, no future of work. what we find is that the future of data and the future of work will go hand in hand. the total volume of data in the datasphere that is created, captured, copied, and consumed in the world is predicted to reach 175 zettabytes by 2025. to give you a much better picture for understanding, if we represent the digital universe as stacks of tablets, there would be 27.25 stacks from earth to the moon.    it’s time to prepare for the data-dominated future as industry 4.0/fourth industrial revolution has begun. so, let’s see how artificial intelligence will affect the following fields:    human resource: nowadays, recruiters use ai-powered tools for hiring workers. using these tools, recruiters get insights into a candidate’s skills, personality and even check whether the candidate is fit for the organization. for example, the company allyo first identifies high-potential candidates through assessment and smart screening, and then automatically schedules interviews using ai. hr departments at large companies receive hundreds of resumes for a job opening. entry-level roles focusing on screening and scheduling will be automated. ai will automate specific hr jobs, not hr roles. a deloitte study found that ai has already eliminated 800,000 low-skilled jobs in the uk, but 3.5 million new jobs were also created. roles that focus on complex decisions like resolving disputes within a department will continue to be a very human endeavor.    finance and accounting: in 2015, a report from accenture named “finance 2020: death by digital” predicted that 40 percent of transactional accounting work would be automated by 2020. has technology replaced the human factor? well, ai has created new jobs involving managing the ai system and using the information to create insights. for example, accounting software has already automated bookkeeping tasks that used to be done by humans, but that’s only opened the door for former bookkeepers to learn skills needed to run and manage the software for employers and clients. advisors are another crucial role of the accounting and finance team. using the information gained from transactions in books, the team creates insights to improve business strategy. owing to automation, the team spends more time analyzing numbers.    marketing and sales: marketing automation has helped companies strategize the proper utilization of the company’s resources, managing time, and achieving budget targets. marketing automation has helped to draw conclusions at a scale no marketer ever would. in this process, marketers and machines both excel in different parts. marketers using ai tools drive more conversions in less time. human intelligence with technology can help identify the right customers to talk to and at the right time. modern marketers understand the insights from any marketing campaign and create it into effective messaging.    engineering: technology is changing in a blink of an eye. the technologies used five years ago in the industry have become obsolete today. engineers will have to keep up with the technological advancements and keep upgrading their skills to stay relevant in the industry. learning to work alongside machines and designing work such that interaction better humans and machines are better are going to be important skills for engineers in the future.        fig: robots takes place the job role of man.    in the 18th and 19th centuries, the rise of the industrial revolution centuries led to millions of people losing their jobs because of scientific advancements. but that also ended in creating millions of other jobs. statisticians have said, when automation destroys jobs, people find new ones. thus, ai holds a more optimistic picture for the future.    in the future, ai is not going to replace humans, rather make jobs more humane. ai will disrupt millions of middle and entry-level jobs in the next few years but will also create millions of additional jobs and help to boost economies.",46,29,0.2266666636444445,0.10204081632653061,7.205882352941177,0.06703487270660585,2.9091668902591135,49.2706314393553,735,2.595918367346939,2,6.382312925170068
14438.8,"abstract    the way work is being done now is destined to undergo massive transformational changes which will impact humans and their ways of working dramatically. with the development of the new machine programs, a.i. is all set to take over the humans in their workplace as no other did. now we are not only in competition with other beings but with robots too. and robots will overcome us in our fields of work.        at present we are being surrounded by a.i. from dusk till dawn, from facial recognition present in our mobile application to dating websites/applications which uses decision making as their algorithms and learn from the past data as well. it is believed that a.i. has grown over 270% over the last years.    first, let us know what a.i. is and all the fuss going on about it?a.i. as defined by the internet is simply ‘simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions’. this translates to, it can work as a human being just at fast speed and with 100% accuracy.in my definition i would define a.i. as the god form of human beings.    now the question that arises is, what does a.i. entails for the future?    a.i. is fancy enough to continue existing in our minds all the time, but it does come with certain limitations and threats which is a cause for a peaceful sleep for most of the workers. with its introduction to different areas of the workplace, it is clear that half of the human jobs would be taken up by a.i. and then there would arise a need for more jobs for humans in new upcoming ai-based ventures in different industries. thereby giving us our fair share back to us.    in a survey, it was found that some believed that ai will be devastating for humans and while some professionals and tech-savvy people believed that inculcating ai technology into business and our daily lives would be a remarkable step as it will lead to the flourishment of business in the future and give them a competitive edge over their rivals.    people believed that when these advanced technologies would come together to work with humans, they will produce a smarter strategic decision with productive collaborative practices. more modern technology prevailing in the organization will lead to stress reduction and produce more satisfying results thereby making the organization more efficient.    the organizations who are in use of the ai technology responds by saying that their managers are more comfortable using a.i. and are accustomed to it and the organizations are now looking forward to having integration of higher-end technology systems, as it is believed that new technology will result in more productivity thereby making more profits in the long run.    many jobs today require ai and humans working in collaboration, which creates a positive signal that in the future to humans would be working closely with the technology. beyond just training and developing these machines, humans would be working in close vicinity with them and making decisions on how to act on the result that is given by the machine.    it can be said that both the ai advanced technology and human can’t remain in the workforce without each other, as the technology will produce accurate and top-notch results but it requires someone to make delivery.e.g., in a firm, an ai-based system produces results based on historical data but there is a need for someone to analyze and communicate and present this data to the respective stakeholders whether inside or outside of the organization.    various uses of artificial intelligence technology in day-to-day functions in regards to interactions with humans are:    chatbotsemail curationa.i. powered advertisingautomated image recognitionself-sufficient drivingvoice activation and much more.    here in this figure a represents ‘artificial intelligence’ and b represents ‘humans’     artificial intelligence as we know works on algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning which all are analytical tools that help ai in taking analytical decisions based on the data provided.    whereas, humans on the other hand take higher-level decisions based on ‘intuition’ sometimes, which refers to the gut feeling that generates in humans concerning any situation or challenge.    ai alone can’t work to handle critical situations on its own as it needs humans for it to reciprocate them and share the information with stakeholders, and humans alone can’t anticipate much on the accurate and fast-paced analytical solutions to the problems persisting in place of the situation.    the strength of humans and ai working in synergy can be surprisingly beneficial and advantageous to organizations.    artificial intelligence and jobs    it is believed that machines in the future would be eating up our traditional jobs. but the reality seems to be turning otherwise.    the future trend shows that in future the ai-powered technology would take up jobs that were being done by humans but in return would produce more jobs that would require human interference with them. as and when the newer technology is approaching more and more countries are now proceeding towards gig economies, and so in the future, we can witness an increase in freelance jobs and the permanent labor market norms could reduce drastically.    some of the jobs today will be replaced by ai which is in the transportation or retail commerce sector that can be 100% automated in the future years. there is an ‘amazon go’ store that uses this technology which goes by the name ‘just walk out technology’ wherein there is no need for any human-induced workforce and all the operations are carried out by ai-powered technologies, which is indeed a breakthrough technology in today’s world.    rather than eating up our jobs ai in return will be creating more jobs in the future by creating massive innovations thereby fueling up many new industries and thereby giving us our fair share of jobs back.    there will be a lot of demand placed on the upcoming young workforce which is also categorized as ‘gen z’. they are expected to know more about technology and would be high in demand.  these young generations are required to learn new skills which are needed to survive in the dynamic changing environment, and as most of the activities that are carried out by workers will be automated, there will be demand for people working in the back office and maintaining and developing the technology to its best versions.      artificial intelligence and its constraints    ai powered technology has its limitations which makes it a rigid system to hold on to and also which makes it a costly affair at the initial stage.      it was predicted that the cost of electricity to power a supercharged ai model was around $4.6 million. so, this super-powered ai can be purchased only by big fortune firms and thereby creating more value to their net worth.    one of the major limitations of ai is that it can contain biased data as the scientists who put in the data can create biasedness and so the resultant output of the same would have a biased report.    these machines as do not have neuroscience-based technology in them yet which enables them to carry human emotions to understand complex situations and a creative way out of that, they tend to have a lack of out of box thinking which in the case is rigid in themselves as they are programmed to work on a single task and they cannot perform more than a single task at the same time.    it is also believed that there exists no creativity among the computer, no matter it is fast-paced, but they are not intelligent.    preparing for the future    business and organization    businesses and organizations need to understand and anticipate the opportunities that the future holds for them and they need to start training their employees based on today’s dynamic changing technology. while it’s still unclear what does the future holds for us, but the anticipation of it could benefit us in several ways.    as we are unclear about what the future looks like, we need to think in probable terms how it could turn out to be and then employ specific training programs for the employees of the organization.the training the employees are needed to be done on a continuous and lifetime basis which means that education won’t be only limited to pg degrees but will be now a lifetime process of learning.    as the covid-19 changed the scenario of the work patterns around the world, we now need to think strategically about the working dynamics of the future and how does it look like compared to the pre-covid and post-covid scenario.    employees will be playing a major role in transforming the organizations and work practices in the upcoming future, so organizations need to select and recruit the best candidates among the pool and then provide them with best practices of the new machines and make proficient in their area of work. policies need to be developed to hire the best people and then retaining the talent in the organization.    there needs to be a continuous scanning of the environment by the organizations to comprehend any new trends and assess them, not all trends will be beneficial for organizations, they must be aware of the prospects and plan for the future systematically and consistently.    conclusion    there lies a possibility in future certain years from now, we could have machines who will have general human intelligence who would be able to answer deep meaningful questions asking ‘why are the curtains blue?’, would be able to clean cars, play politics and tell jokes to us, and by using deep and machine learning programs their level of intelligence would be beyond mathematical calculations to us. that’s how good machines will be in the future, but to make ourselves competitive with machines, we would need to train ourselves for the impending ambiguous future ahead of us.    humans and machines need to work in synergy to get beneficial and satisfying results for both parties.    machines are indeed going take away many of our jobs, but let me make you sleep peacefully tonight, the machines aren’t arriving until we’re retired.",77,24,0.5247524700519558,0.11854460093896714,8.352941176470589,0.11949694699873216,3.3889752493877285,101.8113988429198,852,2.738262910798122,10,6.698356807511737

15824.2,"ai experts believe it’s going to be one of the main drivers of the fourth industrial revolution and that it has the potential to not just transform the tech sectors and going to open a new chapter of the society of the world that people try to understand themselves better rather than the outside world with ai because people who are naysayer and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios are pretty irresponsible. after all, in the next, five to ten years ai is going to deliver so many improvements and the quality of our lives it is a renaissance, a golden age of machine- learning and artificial intelligence that was the realm of science fiction for the last several decades. ai is probably the most important thing humanities that have ever worked which is more profound than any work with technology, as it is important to harness the benefits and while minimizing the downside is focusing on autonomous systems like self-driving cars seen as the mother of all ai projects and has made applications like self-driving technology viable for the first time, three things happen at the same time number one data collection and data processing became easier because of better technologies right um you need data to fuel ai training and that’s been one of the big drivers the second thing that has happened is that computer processing has become faster that’s like the engine so no matter how much fuel you have if you don’t have that engine and processing the data on a timeframe that’s reasonable was just not possible and the third thing that’s happened is that new algorithms have been developed which has made ai much more powerful so #technology has been changing and developing at a pace that’s much faster than ever before and we have not been used to this rapid pace of change which means that we have not been used to thinking about how it’s going to impact our immediate future. the most important factor responsible for the growth of ai is google and its ai what google’s done is given all of us the power to get the relevant information we want at our fingertips this has created a shift in how things are bought but it didn’t happen overnight this started in 2004 but the major change only happens to start 2012 onwards google’s taken away about 65% of sales people’s jobs that were primarily order takers and the ones that are remaining are likely to be gone over the next decade.        in present several ai projects are helping in diagnosing diseases better match up drugs with people depending on what they’re sick they can get treated better so it’s going to help a whole lot of people get treated and get better #healthcare than would have had access to it before if you look at self-driving cars they’re going to be safer than people driving cars and the value that machine learning is providing is actually happening beneath the surface and it is things like improved search results improved product recommendations for customers improve forecasting for inventory management and literally hundreds of other things including speech-recognition or image-recognition that the performance levels are phenomenal  or drug discovery as these biological systems are very complicated because vaccines for tb and hiv developing that’s notably enabled by this rich data advanced in biology and machine learning and recent invention in which is an application we just launched for anybody with visual impairment ass it uses the latest cutting-edge computer vision technology to give anyone the ability to see, so anyone who has dyslexia can now use ai to be able to read better and with the  latest release of windows 10 has this capability called ij’s which enable the eye muscle that the gaze can help to type. like the two sides of the coin, there are negative impacts of ai as well  bill gates ellen musk also tech giants in a way their views are pessimistic, to say the least, they warned against the potential of ai to replace humans in the workplace and ella masks even went as far as to claim that ai is the biggest existential threat to mankind. because of the loss of a job, when you think about a job or a career choice if a majority of the tasks that comprise that career choice is likely to be these vulnerable tasks then that is a career at risk in the future so what are the tasks that ai will find? hard to do anything unpredictable anything that requires skills like creative thinking or empathy or interpersonal skills but it’s important to understand tomorrow whether google is there or not, artificial intelligence is going to progress you know technology has just nature it’s that it’s going to evolve as  technology and in particular ai can, in fact, bring more empowerment more inclusiveness and at the same time it is important to be clear-eyed about displacement and unintended consequences like any other technology and work both skills so that people can find the jobs of the future create new jobs also the policy decisions that help people as they go through this change people already unhappy because of machine learning artificial intelligence as they think  if they’re not innovative enough or not creative enough your job will be taking away by a lot of machines ai for business going to affect the future of work specifically there are jobs that are at more risk of being taken over by ai and automation there is very wide dissonance on this, there are different reports that have been shared by  oxford study that says 47% of us jobs are at risk of automation over the next few years meanwhile the general population and workers think differently a recent study conducted by college actually identifies that 97% of workers believe that most jobs will be automated but not their own this suggests that the general public needs to be educated on which jobs are  susceptible to this risk which are not and businesses need to be aware of the forthcoming skills gap of course not all jobs are equal the oxford study that highlights this they examined 700 participants and found the generalist occupations that require creative knowledge or innovation are at least risk the same is true for occupations in education healthcare media and arts jobs on the flip side jobs like telemarketers junior lawyers accountants are at most risk in short there is a simple rule of thumb if your job is in some way predictable or routine the risk of automation is much higher if a job doesn’t require innovation or creativity then the return on investment for companies is higher on machines than real-time employees machines are faster can’t be distracted and can work 24/7 this is actually good for creative marketers because ai and automation can serve to augment their jobs rather than substituting them as impact of emerging technologies on the creative economy they stated that artificial intelligence is changing  creative content from beginning to end by 2030 ai will be able to write high school essays code in python composed top 40s chart songs and make creative videos but all of these advancements also come with risks and costs take a look at this report by the global commission on the future of work in the absence of effective transition policies many people will have to accept lower skilled and lower paying jobs high-skilled workers are taking less cognitively demanding jobs displacing less educated workers and this is already happening also technological dividends are being unevenly distributed among firms a very limited amount of companies tend to dominate when it comes to big data just think about google and facebook today they alone are responsible for 70% of the referral marketing traffic and  receive more than 50% of total global advertising budget so the question is in businesses workers and social institutions go into the same direction if companies and public policy leaders can understand the evolving landscape they can help the workforce anticipate the upcoming challenges technology and the demographic changes are leading to a smaller workforce compared to the previous generation and a workforce that has to pursue many careers during their time of work we need to provide workers with an environment where they can continuously upskill and grow governments will have to re-evaluate the educational system we will have to continuously learn and grow and companies will have to redesign their structure and their culture around technology just like during the industrial revolution we are heading into a new age and the great transformation that we’re about to see by 2022 it is estimated that 20 to 25 percent of the labor force will be displaced within 10 to 20 years however this is also an opportunity for people to get ahead for which different ways have to be find to attract and retain highly skilled workers and allow them the time to up skill themselves even during work hours and it is a  good way  to develop a learning community to benefit from each other and also to use technology to supplement goal tracking and  efforts instead of as a distraction in short what we are doing is  to bridge the dissonance and it is imperative to build a  map of how ai and automation will affect  industry and  company if this is an economic imperative how do people feel about committing itself to a lifelong approach to knowledge as  these risks are important but it is important to do things like from being upfront to have ethical charters like ai safety and to be very transparent and open and how we perceive progress there and figure out global frameworks by which we can engage just like paris agreement and climate change by using  such forums bring people together as they engage on the hard questions and it will emerge answers and on the question of whether ai is a threat or not, artificial intelligence is not  a threat because there is a rare case where people need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because i think by the time we are reactive in ai regulation it’s too late right now we have machine learning algorithms that can solve an incredibly complex problem beyond any human intelligence  as they are mere machines that can be given enormous data set and they come up with brilliant correlations and insights but they’re not going threaten the human population anytime soon because fish intelligent isn’t terrible but human being a smart enough to learn that skills at least to have a complete toolbox to be prepared volatility of the future

16286.0,"ever wondered how you get notified of the products or services you want or you have been looking for for a long time. now how does this happen? let me start with the simple and the most known fact- marketing, marketing is a common term which everyone knows and is aware of. marketing is the action of promoting products and services, including market research and advertising. traditional marketing was working fine for all these years. so why there was a need for online marketing? the story begins from the internet era, the online presence of customers- there are 4.72 billion people are on internet users in the world today and the number is increasing day by day. so if the companies want to create awareness about their products and services their is a huge audience present online. there are a lot of benefits of online marketing like a large audience, benefits of targeting on the basis of demographics, location, age, gender, and many more. because of this diversity, almost every type of company can use the internet to reach any audience. all would find something of their liking. let’s take a look at what does online marketing involves. types of online marketing social media advertising these days, almost everybody is on social media. the majority of people use facebook, twitter, instagram, and other social media platforms to communicate with their friends and relatives. some people have created companies solely based on their social media activity. you can, however, promote your knowledge commerce products through social media. whether or not you advertise on these sites. the best social media networks for advertising- facebook advertising instagram advertising twitter advertising pinterest advertising linkedin advertising snapchat advertising content marketing content marketing is a strategic marketing strategy that focuses on producing and delivering useful, appropriate, and reliable content in order to attract and maintain a specific audience — and, eventually, to drive profitable consumer action. in simple words, content marketing is a marketing strategy that producers and delivers relevant and reliable content to attract potential clients and to also retain existing clients. ppc/search advertising about half of all website traffic originates from a search engine. people who use searches are often high-intent buyers. this indicates that they are searching for a particular item. they’re all set to buy the products and services. the majority of online marketing is focused on pay-per-click (ppc). however, when you hear the word “ppc,” it refers to search ads. pay-per-click (ppc) advertising on search engines, social media sites, and other online venues can be extremely successful. so the next time when you search for a product and services and you find similar ads on the internet this is a kind of internet marketing. e-mail marketing email marketing is the highly successful digital marketing technique of sending emails to prospects and consumers. it allows communicating directly with the present, former, and potential customers. businesses will inform the audience about new products as they become aware of them. banner advertising banner ads are rectangular or square advertisements that appear above, in the sidebar, or below the content on websites. usually, a banner ad leads to a sales or landing page. you will get great results by running banner ads on websites that attract members of the target audience. affiliate marketing an affiliate marketer, like a car salesperson, only gets paid when someone buys the stuff. you may not have to pay if there are no purchases. affiliates are free to sell your goods anywhere they choose (as long as the material follows the terms of service

16747.8,"evolution of advertising industry over the years. advertising can be described as a type of specific content broadcasting to a larger audience; the form can take several different forms, and the intended message can differ from genre to genre. the target for each medium could be different. advertised content could be in print, radio, tv, or digital formats. we’ll look at how the advertising market has changed over the last ten decade. advertising is a form of communication that aims to persuade a target audience. typical advertising messages endorse programs, goods, concepts, people, and companies.  first, conventional types of advertising were used to carry out advertising. let’s take a look at the traditional forms of advertising. advertising can include in-flight advertising, street furniture, passenger displays, billboards, skywriting, posters, wall paintings, banners, taxi cabs, passenger screens, television, and newspaper advertisements. press advertising- other types of advertising include press advertisements in magazines and newspapers. advertising in the classified section of a newspaper is an example of press advertising. a billboard or digital screen placed on a moving vehicle is often referred to as a mobile billboard. guerrilla advertising- when a brand or product is used in a large entertainment venue, it is known as convert ads or guerrilla advertising.  when a soft drink, a watch, or a pair of sneakers is seen or mentioned in a common film, this is an example of this. in-store advertising- ad in supermarket videos, aisles, and on the inside of shopping carts is referred to as in-store advertising. consumers are influenced by celebrity advertisements because of the power of wealth, fame, and popularity. however, if a celebrity falls out of favor, the use of that celebrity may be detrimental to a company. non-commercial ads- religious organizations, political parties, political candidates, and special interest groups are examples of noncommercial ads. these were the conventional forms of advertisement, but as the internet and technology progressed, the advertising industry began to play a role in helping brands establish a digital presence and advertising their products in a new way. the advertising industry is a multibillion-dollar global company that connects producers with customers. according to the research firm emarkerter, global media advertising spending totaled nearly $629 billion in 2018, with digital advertising accounting for nearly 44% of that amount. for more than a decade, consumers’ perspectives have been shifted in favor of commercials. advertisements are created based on the preferences of the target audience, and as the population has become more tech-savvy, advertising agencies have shifted their focus from conventional to digital advertising. the internet, as well as the devices, used to access it. internet advertising has evolved from a risky gamble to the main marketing medium for most businesses. digital advertising continues to expand by double digits on an annual revenue basis in the united states, with overall spending exceeding $129 billion in 2019. mobile marketing- mobile advertising is a form of advertising that uses wireless devices such as smartphones, tablets, and personal digital assistants to view advertisements. in the consumer goods and retail industries, it is extremely necessary. mobile advertising contents tailored to particular age groups present an opportunity for the mobile advertising industry. the challenges that the mobile advertising industry faces pose a significant risk of new entrants. content marketing content marketing is an old trend that has resurfaced. many marketers have struggled to determine how powerful banners and display advertising on other people’s content are. companies are embedding their marketing pitch within the content itself, rather than serving an ad. this can take the form of publisher-tailored content that the advertiser can support or content that the advertiser publishes directly. there are different kinds of businesses and websites that have used content marketing to grow and flourish in the industry. content marketing is a trend that has contributed a large amount of income to the advertisement industry. to summarise, the advertising industry has evolved through time and will continue to do so as technology advances, allowing advertisers to reach a wider audience and gain a greater understanding of the people to whom they are delivering material. the advertising industry will continue to develop in tandem with innovation. people are also becoming more jaded when it comes to advertisements, pushing businesses to come up with new ways to convey their messages. however, advertisement has a promising future.

17209.6,"before we get into the whole discussion, let’s first discuss the basic working of data analysis. data analysis is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information for business decision-making. using data analysis, we can extract useful information from the given data and then take corresponding decisions based upon the analyzed data. during the pandemic known as covid-19, many businesses failed to grow whereas many touched the sky, for example, the transportation of raw materials was drastically low because:  the nationwide lockdown was imposed, low production due to a smaller number of workers, storage facilities were shut down, and many more for such reasons.  on the other hand, new business/startups got a chance to compete in the market by getting early responses from the companies they wanted to tie up with or from the head of the companies that they wanted investments from. the data analysis can help businesses in many ways such as:  using different statistical models that are used in data analysis, the businesses can predict the approximate requirement for the product in the near future and hence they can produce it accordingly. it makes it easier to track the requirement and produce the product accordingly. because of the lockdown, people had to start working from home, which became a huge advantage for the businesses as they would get quicker responses from their tie-ups. using data analysis, businesses can create several models and structures to measure the growth of the company and also to make devised plans to increase the revenues and decrease the losses.  data analysis provides different analytical techniques such as:  text analysis statistical analysis diagnostic analysis predictive analysis prescriptive analysis  using these techniques, businesses can analyze everything and predict almost anything. these techniques, tools, and models, can help businesses tackle this horrendous situation that is covid-19.",5,4,0.11111109876543349,0.04864864864864865,1.8137254901960784,0.021859197621719298,0.7342338751271191,4.04395156001807,185,2.7621621621621624,0,6.848648648648648
18133.2,"the covid- 19 pandemics forced factories to shut down, flights getting canceled and a massive decrease in the global economy, with a significant decrease in green house gases (ghg) in many developed and developing countries. the sars- cov2 came into the spotlight in december 2019 and has impacted most of the countries till then. nearly 131 million peoples were infected worldwide and resulting in deaths of around 2.9 million according to world health organisation (who). most of the countries dealt with the new virus by imposing strict lockdowns and social distancing to control the spread of the virus. these policies caused adverse effects worldwide. one of the most important impacts of the covid-19 pandemic is on the environment. there have been few positive impacts on the environment due to lockdown like, air pollution has decreased dramatically, as people were asked to stay in their houses due to the lockdowns. there has also been a sharp decline in environmental noise. environmental noise can be well defined as the unwanted or harmful outdoor sounds caused by human activities like noise emitted by road traffics, air traffics, rail traffics, and industrial activities. it is one of the most important challenges in the modern era as noise pollution can cause adverse effects on humans as well as harm many animals too. the imposition of lockdown and quarantine by various nation’s governments has caused people to remain back at their homes. because of this, the movement of people from one place to a different place has reduced significantly and the use of personal and public transport has also decreased. due to all these changes, the environmental noise generated in most of the cities has dropped substantially.  water pollution at beaches have reduced significantly and many animals were spotted back in the cities, but the covid-19 virus has also generated many negative and indirect effect on the environment. to begin with, some of the developed countries have halted their sustainability program during the pandemic. in the united states and in many other european nation-states, waste recycling plants have been suspended in many municipalities and cities due to the concern of the virus getting spread at the recycling centers. this has resulted in an increase in the use of single-use plastic bags instead of the re-usable bags by many leading restaurants, firms, and corporations. for instance, starbucks, a leading coffee company during the month of march 2020, has announced a short-lived ban on the utilization of recyclable and reusable cups. furthermore, with most of the people staying indoors because of the lockdown majority of the department stores, shops, restaurants, and food outlets are closed, making an online purchase and food delivery are quite high. this has created more consumption and demand for fossil fuels due to the transportation and mobility of these goods to each individual. there has been an enormous upsurge of medical waste- because most of the products employed by healthcare professionals are usually single-use items that can be used only once before they are disposed of. some of these wastes include used masks, personal protection kits, and gloves. for instance, nearly 200 tons of medical waste were generated during the peak of the pandemic breakout in wuhan, china. this is 50 tones more than the average waste generated before the outbreak in wuhan.  these organic and inorganic wastes generated due to the policies crafted by the government takes a heavy toll on the environment and can cause environmental issues like water pollution, air pollution, soil erosion, and can harm the local flora and fauna. the demand for masks during the pandemic has become skyrocketing but the materials required for the production of these masks are highly dangerous for the environment as they are generally composed of non-woven fabrics. polyester, polystyrene, polyethylene, and polycarbonate, are some common materials used for the surgical mask with density lying between 20grams to 25 grams/sq. meter. these materials are mostly resistant to liquids and are plastic-based products with a really high afterlife after being discarded. if not treated properly without discarding, they end up filling the landfills and the oceans making it dangerous to aquatic lifeforms. for example, recently the environment in hong kong has started degrading drastically during the pandemic with the accumulation of these clinical wastes.  with recycling plants on hold, piles of small mountains of wastes and their depositions at open areas are formed due to the increasing number of unrecycled wastes generated every day. this makes the surrounding more vulnerable and also creating a high risk of air pollutions as the dumped open wastes decays into methane (ch4), a greenhouse gas, hence increasing the risk of global warming too.  not only the surroundings are getting affected by these careless methods, but the local people are also getting affected. if the excess methane gets accumulated in the earth’s atmosphere due to piles of unrecycled wastes, this could result in increases in earth’s average temperature and can be harmful to future generations. many protected and endangered flora and fauna are facing much greater risks due to the imposition of the lockdown. many countries under lockdown have made people stay inside their homes. the employees, ngos, and volunteers working in these protected areas like national parks, marine conservation zones, and wildlife sanctuaries are made to stay at home making these protected and endangered flora and fauna unattended. this has also led to an increase in many illegal activities like wildlife hunting, illegal deforestation, and fishing activities due to the absence of these people. the prohibition of eco-tourism has also led to a significant financial drop in the economy of these protected areas. some nations like china have asked the local authorities and native government bodies to increase the amount of disinfection routine, mainly to increase the dosage of chlorine in the wastewater treatment plant to prevent the spread of the covid-19 virus. however, according to who (2020), no solid evidence has been found on the survival of the virus on the lifespan of the virus in wastewater as well as in drinking water. despite the fact that excessive amounts of chlorine in water can cause harmful problems and issues associated with people’s health like bladder cancer and it also damages its cells. the covid-19 is a reminder that the health of the planet is also linked to the health of humans. evidence proves that the virus is zoonotic, meaning it can be transmitted between people and animals. they are accountable for seventy-five percent of all emerging infectious diseases in the world. with the virus infecting millions of people every day across the globe, various governments and agencies’ top priority is to regulate the spread of the virus by shifting the spotlight on the management and treatment of wastes (especially the clinical and medical waste).  likewise, at the same time, we as responsible individuals need to step up and follow the necessary guideline and precautions for the disposal of the waste and medical gears.  in spite of various data showing that the pollutions have reduced significantly during the pandemic, history has witnessed a rise in pollution during any “post-financial crisis”.  a similar case was observed during the 2008 financial crash – although there was a temporary decrease in emissions of 1.3% was observed, but as the economy recovered in 2010, emissions were at an all-time high. after all, only through sheer mutual empathy and goodwill that the world will emerge stronger after this global pandemic. to prevent future outbreaks, we must address regularly the threats to the ecosystems and wildlife, including habitat loss, illegal trade, pollution, and climate change as human life depends on earth’s life. if you live near a spacious outdoor area, like the desert or an empty road lined with trees and you realize it’s the only safe, surface-less space to take a walk in, then you begin to realize the beauty of nature. the point is not to remain indoors, but to avoid being in close contact with others. when you do leave your home, whether it is for a walk in the desert or a run on your street, make sure to wipe down any surfaces you come into contact with, avoid touching your face, and frequently wash your hands.",36,69,-0.31428571129251703,0.13761467889908258,7.480392156862745,0.07723583159674152,3.023051195383795,58.930939508313784,763,2.7247706422018347,0,6.741808650065531
18595.0,"even though covid-19 has not yet halted and we are facing the nth wave of the coronavirus outbreak across several countries, most notably the us, india, and brazil. it is a fact that data analytics and ai are the big guns of our artillery in this fight against the covid-19 pandemic. it has helped us in several stages of this outbreak, like the detection of its first outbreak, vaccine development and manufacturing contact tracing, and future hotspot detection. some of these interesting applications are discussed in this article. a lesser-known fact is that the covid-19 outbreak was first detected in toronto, canada, nearly 7,230 miles away from the first outbreak, nine days before the who issued its warning. it was with the help of big data analytics and ai, more specifically deep learnings (dl, a subset of machine learning) application in natural language processing (nlp) to analyze text inputs that traced the surge of pneumonia cases in the wuhan province of china. the specialty of dl algorithms is that they mimic the brain cells called neurons and can identify patterns in big data. this dl-backed software is used as inputs, reports from public health organizations, global airline ticketing data, etc. these were used to flag unusual surges and potential spreads of infectious diseases. the next application of big data analytics and ai was in the research and development of drugs to halt covid-19. ai was used to analyze the protein structure of the virus, findings that were significant in the progress of vaccine development. in preliminary studies, it was found that it does not mutate as fast as other viruses such as hiv, which means that a prophylactic vaccine is a better way to proceed rather than a therapy. but there is also some evidence supporting the fact that when we find any kind of cure for it, there is a chance of the virus mutating, which is what happened and major mutations have been found in the uk, brazil, and south africa. ai also assisted scientists in rapidly shortlisting a set of already available vaccines that could be effective against the coronavirus. another interesting application of ai can be found in the selection of the right candidates, i.e. most likely to test positive for testing coronavirus in case of insufficient testing resources. this method was first exercised on greek borders and was called project eva. whenever a traveler wanted to come into greece, he had to fill out a form known as passenger locator form (plf) at least 24 hours prior to arrival, containing information on their origin country, demographics, point, and date of entry, and the intended destination. eva then allocated testing resources according to the size of the set of passengers to be tested. after the test results, if found positive, they are put in quarantine. the results were sent back to the program for real-time learning. the question remains how eva made allocations, it was found that, statistically, only the origin country and the city were significant factors for screening. ultimately, from a variety of countries and city pairs, eva had to predict how many testing resources were to be allocated at each entry point and to particular passengers from a location is technically called the multi-armed bandit (mab) problem, and the chosen method to solve this problem was an ai algorithm called optimistic gittins index. this algorithm identified on average 1.85x as many asymptomatic, infected travelers as random surveillance testing, and up to 2-4x as many during peak travel. after the test results, if found positive, they are put in quarantine. following the collection of significant data through the aforementioned process, after a certain period, policies were made categorizing them separately and imposing restrictions on travelers from the specific location. this eva as presented above was in operation from august 6th to november 1st processing around 38,500 plfs each day and testing on an average 18.5% of households entering the country every day. above mentioned applications just show the tip of the iceberg and there is more to get into some of the other developments to watch for include the use of image recognition to identify covid based on x-ray images, the use of deep learning to predict the 3-d protein structure associated with covid-19 and so on.",21,14,0.19999999428571447,0.089058524173028,3.8529411764705883,0.05246207429212632,1.562161300305086,20.617595196805645,393,2.633587786259542,2,6.569974554707379
19056.8,"“data is the new oil” has become the most important trendline of the 21st century. the reason for this is the advancements in the fields related to data analysis. the field of ai machine learning statistics and data mining all deal with data and are developing at such a staggering pace, that these fields have become the most popular buzzwords these days.
 
 
 
 buzzwords are originated through technical terms but often the underlying essence is ignored through fashionable use and mainly used to impress. this is the main reason for the misconception amongst people. ai, ml, stats, data mining, and many other fields related to the analysis of data are most often mistook for one and the same thing, thus all these words are often used interchangeably to convey one and the same thing. but this is not true at all!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 the only similarity between these disciplines is that all of these disciplines are related to the analysis of the data and converting this data into “information”.
 
 
 
 in academics, while learning ai machine learning statistics and data mining, the academic approach only wander in the technical definitions and concepts but the underlying essence and the aim of the discipline remain unexplored, same is the case with most of the articles out there which try to explain the difference. thus, becoming the primary cause of confusion between learners. hence, this article explains the difference by explaining the philosophy and the aims of each of the disciplines rather than wandering in the technical definitions.
 
 
 
 
 
 then what is the difference between ai machine learning statistics and data mining?
 
 
 
 
 
 the essential difference between these disciplines lies in their “aims” and the approach taken to achieve those aims.
 the aims of each of these fields are explained in detail in the following sections:
 
 
 
 
 
 artificial intelligence:
 
 
 
 
 
 the aim of artificial intelligence is to understand intelligent entities. then to satisfy this aim, we must first understand what is intelligence and what makes an agent intelligent agent? the answer to all these questions can be found by studying intelligent agents and the best example of an intelligent agent can be found by just standing in front of a mirror! yes! humans are the best examples of intelligent entities. thus, in the 1900s, researchers began exploring the thought process, the reasoning process of humans as human beings were considered as an ideal intelligent agent. mimicking human behavior became the aim of ai in the initial years of the research. after setting this goal, studies and experiments began and the most famous experiment conducted in the initial years to achieve this aim was the turing test! turing defined intelligent behavior as the ability to achieve human-level performance in all cognitive tasks, sufficient to fool an interrogator. but this test received criticism as only mimicking human behavior is not exactly intelligence. because intelligence should be related to the working of the human brain as without the human brain, intelligence has no meaning!
 
 
 
             thus, mimicking human thought processes and reasoning became the transformed aim. the field of psychology and philosophy also resonate with this aim that is to understand the human thought process. the difference is that ai not only tries to understand the thought process but to mimic it, build it. the collaboration of these fields resulted in models such as neural networks which try to mimic the function of neurons present in the human brain. so, basically, this initial aim was human-centered and humans were considered as the ideal intelligent agent.
 
 
 
 concurrently, the field of computer science was developing at a greater pace. with the advances in computer science, the experiments and theories could be easily tested and validated. as programs were being applied to solve real-life problems, it was found that computers performed better than humans at some tasks that are really complex for humans. one of the best examples of this could be the chess-playing program. an ai program defeated the world’s best chess player garry kasparov. this incident indicated that human intelligence is not the ultimate intelligence or else a human would have been able to defeat the ai program. this leads to a question, is human intelligence the ideal intelligence?
 
 
 
 as computers became more advanced, they proved to be better than humans at certain complex tasks. that is why the new definition of intelligence was being related to the ability to solve cognitive tasks or problems. so, rather than considering the nature of agents, researchers began to study the nature of intelligence itself. then the question comes how to test or validate intelligence? the best way to test intelligence is to solve cognitive problems. an agent can be said intelligent only if it can solve a complex problem. the problem-solving approach can be easily tested and validated on computers. thus, some researchers began studying the ideal intelligence, and the selected agent to validate the experiments was the computer. so, a computer and problem-solving approach were adopted. so, the human-centered approach and computer, problem-solving approach are the two main aims of ai. both of these fields have contributed to the field by giving valuable insights.
 
 
 
 both the aims are important and both of these collaboratively form the main aim of ai!
 
 
 
 
 
 machine learning:
 
 
 
 
 
 in the problem-solving approach, there is a big challenge that ai has to overcome in order to achieve its aim. consider the example of solving a math problem. there are two cases by which intelligence can be tested in this problem-solving approach. let us say two math problems are given for you to solve. the first problem is familiar to you and the second problem is not.
 
 
 
 consider the first problem. the first problem is familiar to you, that means you know how to solve such kind of problems as you have already solved some similar problems in the past. so, there comes a question, how our mind is able to solve that problem? the answer is, that you have solved similar problems in the past, thus you have learned from the past data, how to solve such problems, thus even if you haven’t seen that problem in the past, you will still be able to solve similar problems. this is one form of intelligence.
 
 
 
 consider another case where you are given a second problem where you have not solved such kind of problems in the past. then to solve this problem, you will try to consciously gather and manipulate the given information so that you reach a certain conclusion. this kind of approach does not necessarily rely on the past data but completely on the reasoning process. this is the second kind of intelligence.
 
 
 
 for ai to build intelligent agents, both of these kinds of intelligence must be developed in the agent. but, the reality is that ai has reached the point where it is able to build agents which can only learn from past data and find some useful information. ai today has not reached a point where it can build agents who can think on their own. that is the second type of intelligence.
 
 
 
 so, the way ai is able to implement the first type of intelligence is through machine learning! so, the domain of ai which focuses solely on implementing the first kind of intelligence is in fact machine learning. that is the reason why ml is called the subset of ai! so, this is the main difference between ai and ml.
 
 
 
 technically speaking, “it is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn from past data and find some meaningful conclusions, patterns without being explicitly programmed”. this statement needs some elaboration. the essence of ml is related to the process of “generalization” and learning from past data. generalization is an abstraction by which common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims. consider how we humans recognize daily life objects. if we see an animal, then we can easily recognize if it is a “dog” or a “cat”. it is a very trivial task for us but have you ever wondered how our mind is able to do it? the answer is generalization!
 
 
 
 if you were given a picture of a dog, you can easily recognize that it is a picture of a dog, because, our minds have abstracted the description of a dog and formulated it into a “concept” of what a dog is and these concepts became better and better as we learned from the past experiences of a dog. so, the way we think is dependent on the fact that things are represented as generalized concepts in our minds.
 
 
 
 with generalization only, can come real “information”. so, we try to give computers the ability to generalize the “raw data” and convert it into “information” which can be patterns and trends in the data on their own.
 
 
 
 
 
 statistics:
 
 
 
 
 
 this is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. statistics tries to deal with data with the only aim that is to explain it. so, it is the study of explaining the data itself! statistics has two main domains which are descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.
 
 
 
 descriptive statistics deals with the explanation or description of data thus the name “descriptive” statistics. it tries to explain as much information as possible, easily about the whole large data which would be a very complex task otherwise.
 
 
 
  inferential statistics try to make accurate inferences from the available small data. we use inference in many tasks in our daily lives. consider a simple case of cooking a soup. after completing the recipe, you will taste a small sample, that is, a spoonful of the soup to check if the soup tastes good or bad. depending upon the result of the sample, you make an inference about the whole soup that if the soup as a whole, good or bad. similarly, in statistics, there are cases where you have to apply inference to have meaningful information. for example, consider a case where you cannot gather the whole data because it is very time-consuming and costly. in these cases, applying inference based on the available sample introduces uncertainty. that is where inferential statistics come for help.
 
 
 
 so, the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision-making in the face of uncertainty is what statistics deals with. so, however, and whatever the data, statistics tries to explain that data. this aim does not resonate with that of ai and ml, but statistics help these fields to correctly interpret the data!
 
 
 
 
 
 data mining:  
 
 
 
 
 
 “data”, is not useful at all in its raw form. consider examples of sensors used in industrial applications. these sensors might be used in a manufacturing plant to sense different properties like temperature, pressure, etc. the raw data generated by these sensors are not useful until and unless it is converted to a suitable form, then processed, analyzed to gather valuable insights, which can be used to solve a problem!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 due to its unique aim of capturing the essence of very large datasets, to gather insights, data mining is also referred to as “knowledge discovery”. that is why, carly fiorina, former ceo of hewlett-packard once said, “the goal is to turn data into information and information into insight”. this statement completely explains the aim of data mining!
 
 
 
             so, the difference between ai machine learning statistics and data mining lies in their aims. but the approaches taken in all of these fields, help in one way or the other in fulfilling the aims of the other fields. this is the beauty of these fields!",73,42,0.269565215047259,0.11627906976744186,9.696078431372548,0.14135614462045146,3.9349738303971997,139.8012270296265,989,2.6319514661274015,2,6.639029322548028
19518.6,"data science is gaining popularity exponentially over the past decade, and thanks to that we are now enjoying better products, recommendations, and smoother life. data science is an interdisciplinary subject that includes statistics, math, it, etc.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 now there is so much to do in data science,  so we need an arrangement where all this can be accessible in one place. it will be very hectic to go to hundreds of different resources while doing analysis or building models. but don’t worry, python is there for you.
 
 
 
 yes, you read it right, python is a general programming language that can provide everything you need for data science. several features that have made python become the choice of data science in past times are:
 
 
 
 1. python is a progressively typed language, so the variables are defined automatically.
 
 
 
 2. python is more readable and uses lesser code to play out a similar task when contrasted with other programming languages.
 
 
 
 3. python is specifically typed. in this way, developers need to cast types manually.
 
 
 
 4. python is an interpreted language. this implies the program need not have complied.
 
 
 
 5. python is flexible, convenient, and can run on any platform effectively. it is adaptable and can be integrated with other third-party software effectively.
 
 
 
 now let’s see why python become the choice of data science:
 
 
 
 pandas
 
 
 
 this library available in python makes it very easier to analyze the data, you can read a variety of data sets like csv, xml, xlsx, json, etc. you can perform several operations like groupby, sorting with the help of easily accessible objects from pandas.
 
 
 
 numpy
 
 
 
 this package helps you with any numerical operation that is needed to be performed in data science, for example calculating euclidean distance, finding ranks of the matrix, etc.
 
 
 
 matplotlib and seaborn
 
 
 
 these are excellent data visualization libraries available in python that produce some excellent visualization like shown here,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 sklearn
 
 
 
 it provides you state of the art machine learning algorithms for your accurate predictive analysis. scikit–learn is characterized by a clean, uniform, and streamlined api, as well as by very useful and complete online documentation. it provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction via a consistent interface in python.
 
 
 
 keras
 
 
 
 keras is an open-source software library that provides a python interface for artificial neural networks. keras acts as an interface for the tensorflow library. keras is an industry-strength framework that can scale to large clusters of gpus or an entire tpu pod.
 
 
 
 see, now that you have a variety of resources available here in python, then why go anywhere else. python i also becoming the world’s most loved and most wanted programming language and it will surely help to get you the job. data science consulting organizations are empowering their group of developers and data scientists to utilize python as a programming language. python has gotten well-known and the most significant programming language in an extremely brief timeframe. data scientists need to manage a large amount of data known as big data. with simple utilization and a huge arrangement of python libraries, python has become a popular choice to deal with big data.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 seeing the stats we can clearly see that python has taken over other languages needed for data science. it has also surpassed r which is exclusively built for data science. isn’t this exciting.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 python in data science has empowered data scientists to accomplish more in less time. python is an adaptable programming language that can be effectively understood and is exceptionally amazing as well.
 
 
 
 python is highly adaptable and can work in any environment effectively. additionally, with negligible changes, it can run on any operating system and can be integrated with other programming languages. these qualities have settled on python as the top choice for developers & data scientists.

19980.4,"it was in march that tech giant google came up with a ground-breaking announcement of google fit able to measure one’s heart and respiratory rates using their smartphones. this news spread like wildfire. instantly became the talk of the town. this feature was said to be available to the google fit app exclusively to its pixel phone users. google also plans to expand to its other android devices in the future.
 
 
 
 this was after google’s newest endeavor of acquiring the fitbit for a whopping $2.1 billion. this acquisition not only does steps up a stage for a potential google smartwatch but also gives google the ownerships to fitbit’s health business and wealth of data assets. users just need to place their head and upper torso in view of the front-facing phone camera for those who wish to measure their respiratory rate. for measuring heart rate the user just has to place their finger on the rear-facing camera lens. mind-blowing right!
 
 
 
 once the measurements have been taken the users simply have to store and save them in the google fit app to monitor and track their day-to-day wellness. on asked how it’s measuring these heart rate and respiratory rate, google health director of health technologies shwethak patel explained that these features rely on the sensors that have been built into the smartphone, such as its camera, microphone, and accelerometer. thanks to increasingly power sensors even in affordable smartphones and advancements in computer vision, these features let use one smartphone’s camera to track even tiny physical signals like your chest movement to measure your respiratory rate and subtle changes in the color of your finger for your heart rate.
 
 
 
 pixel underwent and completed initial clinical trials to validate the algorithm cloud work in a variety of different world conditions and that too with many people while developing the features. since our heart rate relies on approximating blood flow from color changes in someone’s fingertip, it has to account for factors such as lighting, skin tone, age. adding to be able to measure heart and respiratory rate soon google fit also displays user daily stats such as daily goals, weekly goals, heart points, workout, and also sleep monitor.",8,2,0.599999940000006,0.04504504504504504,2.176470588235294,0.023316477463167253,0.8799148262793844,5.17625799682313,222,2.5,0,6.184684684684685
20442.2,"from what i have learned on the mobile apps development market recently, it is becoming harder for an android or ios developer to find a suitable and well-paying job in the market.
 
 
 
 some major reasons include the increasing supply of mobile engineers, people generally stop downloading apps, and many more.
 
 
 
 in this article, i will go through a more detailed explanation of the recent trend mentioned above and my two cents on what mobile engineers could do to prepare themself for the upcoming challenge! and the future of mobile apps.
 
 
 
 coding bootcamps increase the supply side for mobile apps  developers
 
 
 
 although the demand for mobile developers has not fallen sharply compared with previous years, the growth rate has slowed. on the other hand, owing to a great number of coding boot camps that target to bring up mobile and frontend engineers, a great number of developers are flooding into the developer job market.
 
 
 
 the supply side for mobile engineers has increased rapidly in recent years, raising the standards for qualified mobile engineers. the days of a mobile engineer easily getting over 10 job offers are over.
 
 
 
 recode ran an article in mid-2016, that begins: “the mobile app boom kicked off in july 2008, when apple introduced the app store. now it is over.”
 
 
 
 according to data gathered and analyzed by the cakeresume team, javascript and python are now the most in-demand programming languages for companies who post product development jobs on cakeresume, both together taking up almost half of the job opportunities, while mobile engineers taking up merely 10% of the job opportunities.

 overview
 
 
 
 people stop downloading mobile apps
 
 
 
 while app usage continues to grow and revenue also ascends, the majority of consumers actually download zero apps per month
 
 
 
 let’s face the truth, born and raised up in the era of the information explosion, individuals don’t have the leisure to check on what’s new on the app store every day. when it comes to choosing an app to download, many people feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of options available.
 
 
 
 take the productivity category of the app store as an example, there are over thousands of apps in this category, and new apps popping up almost every week. it is almost impossible for users to dig through and learn all the apps. they just choose what is on top then click install.
 
 
 
 and not to mention that if you could build an awesome productivity app, google and apple could do it 10 times better and faster than you. in the end, there’s not as much need for individual apps to accomplish similar convenience factors.
 
 
 
 what you could do to prepare for the future changes for mobile apps
 
 
 
 although the bull run for mobile development has ended, there are still over 2 billion smartphone users, 27.5 billion mobile apps downloaded, and time spent per day on mobile devices has increased rapidly in recent years. moreover, apps offer a user experience that even ‘responsive websites’ are unable to provide.
 
 
 
 in order to stay on top of the game, you will have to differentiate yourself from the pack — other mobile engineers. if you are a mobile engineer who only knows how to code and tweak your app’s ui, you aren’t that different from others after all. below i listed a few ways that you could implement so that you could stay competitive in the job market.
 
 
 
 1. choose newer technologies when you have the chance
 
 
 
 if you are an android developer, you could start choosing a job involving kotlin or flutter, which are backed by google. if you are an ios developer, try to look for a job to get involved with using swift.
 
 
 
 although older mobile coding languages, such as java and objective-c, still have their upsides, the main reason why kotlin and swift are created at first is to address the older languages issue. it means that kotlin and swift provide many safety mechanisms available out-of-the-box while being more concise and expressive than java and objective-c at the same time.

 objective-c vs swift in 2019
 
 
 
 the article covers a brief comparison between objective-c and swift in 2019, with abi stability.
 
 
 
 2. build up your domain knowledge and industry skills
 
 
 
 this point is especially crucial. each industry has its specific skills to learn and refine. for example, if you are building a stock, foreign exchange, future, or options market app, you will have to understand the websocket protocol, which lets you transfer as much data as you like without incurring the overhead associated with traditional http requests.
 
 
 
 for the streaming media industry, possessing experience with live streaming protocols such as hls, rtmp, webrtc will be a must to deal with streaming-related apps.
 
 
 
 these industry skills can really make you stand out, and adds another layer of expertise to your already pretty impressive mobile engineer title, making you more valuable in the job market.
 
 
 
 3. follow the irresistible tech trend
 
 
 
 the future of mobile app development will be shaped by how businesses harness mobile technology to solve people’s everyday problems.
 
 
 
 don’t try to fight the irresistible trend, see how you can surf the trend! exposing yourself or trying to get a job in the field mentioned below will absolutely give you more opportunities as a mobile developer.
 so what are the trends for mobile apps development?
 
 
 
 
 iot (internet of things)“the driving force behind the growing mobility market is the impact of the iot and its broad reach,” writes the experts at maryville university online. in the future, apps will need to speak to each other, in the same way, that devices in the iot communicate. the market needs companies that can develop custom iot applications — sensors and devices, web apps, and both b2b and b2c mobile end-user apps.
 ai (artificial intelligence)according to experts at maryville university, ai is everywhere, from predictive analytics algorithms used by retailers like target and amazon to anticipate shopping needs to fraud detection monitors from banks and credit cards. some more examples: tinder uses machine learning to increase a user’s chances to find a match. google maps makes the process of choosing a parking spot easier.
 
 ar (augmented reality) and vr (virtual reality)
 tech giants such as apple and google have launched their own augmented reality kits — ar kit and ar core resp to help app developers to create high-quality mobile apps. as for vr, the latest buzzword associated with it is v-commerce. one of the examples is alibaba, which in november of 2016 introduced vr shopping to its customers across china.",37,9,0.6086956389413992,0.07142857142857142,6.313725490196078,0.039346555719094733,2.5412288183660694,25.33918188309701,644,2.4937888198757765,0,6.246894409937888

 health monitoring:
 wearable health trackers-like those from fitbit, apple, garmin, and others- monitor health rate and activity levels. they can send alerts to the user to get more exercise and can share this information with doctors.
 
 
 
 
 technology applications and apps encourage healthier behavior in individuals and help with the proactive management of a healthy lifestyle.
 ai increases the ability for healthcare professionals to better understand the day-to-day patterns and needs of the people they care, for better feedback, guidance, and support.
 
 
 
 
 medical imaging: 
 machine learning algorithms can process unimaginable amounts of information in the blink of an eye and provide more precision than humans in spotting even the smallest detail in medical imaging.  a few of them are blackford, zebra, enlitic, lunit.
 the company “zebra medical vision” developed a new platform called profound, which analyzes all types of medical imaging reports that are able to find every sign of potential conditions such as osteoporosis, aortic aneurysms, and many more with a 90% accuracy rate.
 
 
 
 
 
 digital consultation: 
 for eg, the digital health firm #healthtap developed “dr. ai”, and apps like babylon in the uk use ai to give medical consultations based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illness and asks patients to specify symptoms to triage whether they should go to the ed, urgent care, or a primary care doctor.
 
 
 
 ai robot-assisted surgery: robots have been used in medicine for more than 30 years. surgical robots can either aid a human surgeon or execute operations by themselves. they’re also used in hospitals and labs for repetitive tasks, in rehabilitation, physical therapy, and in support of those with long-term conditions.

 actionable medical insights:  an ever-increasing amount of medical data are being digitized at all public and private healthcare institutions. however, by its very nature, this kind of data is messy and unstructured. unlike other types of business data, where traditional statistical methods can be used for quick insights, patient data is not particularly amenable to simple modeling and analytics tools.
 
 
 
  for eg.- enlitic, a san francisco-based start-up, has a mission of mixing intelligence with empathy and leverage the power of ai in health and medicine for precisely generating.

21365.8,"in today’s world, telemedicine technology is one of those technologies which has brought about a change. compared to the early days there have been remarkable differences in the methods of consultation with a doctor. in the years that have passed by, consultation for a disease with a doctor was quite hectic. it involved waiting, traveling, etc. but with the advent of telemedicine opportunities, this has completely changed.
 
 
 
 it is a rural area that has been completely blessed with the invention of telemedicine. today a considerable amount of people are able to consult doctors remotely. not just doctors, but specialists in various fields of medicine. this has been of great importance as far as rural people are concerned. there are a lot of telemedicine tools that have been found. there are a lot of areas like ophthalmology, oncology, dermatology, etc where the facility of telemedicine has been practiced.
 
 
 
 most of the patients are truly benefitting from telemedicine. patients are pretty satisfied with the consultation they are getting. they don’t have to travel now. they can consult doctors and other specialists from remote areas. the cost of consultation has become pretty much affordable. moreover, they get exposed to highly efficient and qualified experts in the field of medicine.
 
 
 
 on the other hand, there can be patients who do not fully get satisfied through a virtual consultation. rather they might feel that they need to have a direct talk with the doctor, which can boost up their confidence and also it helps to maintain a better relationship with the doctor and patient. the patients feel trust when they talk to doctors face to face. moreover, doctors also might be able to console their patients when they have direct interaction with their patients. there could also be patients who doubt if these virtual methodologies are really trusted worthy or not. it is so because, while the patients have direct contact with their patients, the qualifications are visible to the patients. so there shall be no question of distrust.

22289.4,"in this era, everyone is busy in his life. no one spares time for someone. so robots tackle life loneliness? we have no time to stand and stare. this causes loneliness. loneliness is due to fast-moving life and hurry and worry. in the 21st century, everyone is spending most of their time earning money. they are day-by-day transforming into money-earning machines. due to his perception, we are losing our relations as we can’t give enough time to our families. they are busy earning their livelihood. they never get satisfies and always want more. everyone is in a race of earning and then sends his children far away from himself to make them well settled in order to maintain their status. but one faces the consequences of this kind of lifestyle in his old age. people usually don’t spend time with their children when their children are in their childhood but they yearn for the company of their children in their old age. they feel lonely but have none to talk with. they are still attached to people, places, belongings, and memorable events from the past, although they understand that life cannot continue the same way as earlier, and this may easily result in feelings of loneliness and social isolation. as they become older, they need to be attended to in order to meet their daily needs. robots can indeed serve the purpose but they can aid only mechanical care. they are just emotionless, feeling fewer entities. robots aren’t creative. they can work only according to a pre-programmed system and till now no such software has been created that can transfer human feelings into robots. this is the major loophole of using robots to tackle late-life loneliness. they can undoubtedly serve their masters but their masters can’t share their feelings with them as they are incapable to understand or react to them. they can’t change their activity according to the occasion. they can provide anything except emotional satisfaction and without emotional gratification, loneliness can’t be tackled. a master can be attached to his robot but that attachment is only due to their service. they can’t share their thoughts with them. in this era, we are rendered lonely and in late- life feel the need for a companion with whom we can talk. we feel a need for someone who can listen to us, react, and advise us to tackle our day-to-day life problems. but we can’t find one. we have, undoubtedly, achieved great progress in terms of technology but we can never fill the void in the heart of a person struggling with his late-life loneliness with our advancements. we are in a kind of mental trance in which we experience fame, progress, wealth, etc. but when we gain our consciousness, we find ourselves lonely in this world. relations in life are actual wealth in a person’s life. we can never enjoy such a bond with a robot. it will follow our commands, take our appropriate care but can’t react to our emotions. it can’t console us. when a man lives in loneliness for a long time, it eats up his conscience and transforms him into a machine. robots can never become our friends, crack jokes, weep our tears, or establish an emotional connection with us. they can’t understand our feelings. many people go into depression. depression or the occurrence of depressive symptoms is a prominent condition amongst older people, with a significant impact on their well-being and quality of life. they remain sick and loneliness directly impacts longevity. lonely people often think that they are no longer needed in this world and thus they want to die. it impacts their mental, psychological, social, and physical health. robots prove to be useless in these matters. they can provide motivation, only if they have the software to do so but can’t, themselves, react to such a situation. they don’t know about anger, happiness, or sadness. they don’t themselves bring food when their master is hungry until commanded to do so. they can’t even offer a glass of water themselves. a man living without relations and without fellow feeling no longer remains a human being. he becomes none less than a machine as, due to his loneliness, he becomes mentally ill and goes into a condition like trauma where he no longer enjoys nature’s blessings, becomes happy or sad as he loses the ability to react and hence can’t act. it’s a dangerous situation. we face a plethora of challenges in assisted living facilities such as not being addressed to emotional needs, being neglected, and forcing a withdrawal from social activities. relations in life, interaction with fellow beings, sharing of joy and happiness, and fellow feeling make a man from mere a ‘being’ to a ‘social being’ and finally a human being.",28,36,-0.12499999804687503,0.15724815724815724,3.9901960784313726,0.01894463793882339,1.6036562865480783,7.71046764110112,407,2.5454545454545454,4,6.2653562653562656

 characteristics for future digitalization of healthcare
 
 
 
 
 universal: all organizations, whether it is profit-making or not, require management, for managing their activities. hence it is universal in nature.
 goal-oriented: every organization is set up with a predetermined objective and management helps in reaching those goals timely, and smoothly.
 continuous process: it is an ongoing process that tends to persist as long as the organization exists. it is required in every sphere of the organization whether it is production, human resource, finance, or marketing.
 multi-dimensional: management is not confined to the administration of people only, but it also manages work, processes, and operations, which makes it a multi-disciplinary activity.
 group activity: an organization consists of various members who have different needs, expectations, and beliefs. every person joins the organization with a different motive, but after becoming a part of the organization they work for achieving the same goal. it requires supervision, teamwork, and coordination, and in this way, management comes into the picture.
 
 
 
 
 levels of management
 
 
 
 
 top-level management: this is the highest level in the organizational hierarchy, which includes the board of directors and chief executives. they are responsible for defining the objectives, formulating plans, strategies, and policies.
 middle-level management: it is the second and most important level in the corporate ladder, as it creates a link between the top and lower-level management. it includes departmental and division heads and managers who are responsible for implementing and controlling plans and strategies which are formulated by the top executives.
 lower level management: otherwise called functional or operational level management. it includes first-line managers, foremen, supervisors. as lower-level management directly interacts with the workers, it plays a crucial role in the organization because it helps in reducing wastage and idle time of the workers, improving the quality and quantity of output.
 
 
 
 
 future digitalization of healthcare
 
 
 
     in the current day and age, a wave of digitization has taken over the world. all the emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and others are helping people live better and easier life. the service sector has also benefited a lot from digitization. it got further boost when prime minister narendra modi, in the year 2015, launched a campaign known as ‘digital india.’ among the various industries in the service sector, digitization has had a massive impact on the operation of the healthcare and diagnostic industry. it has helped in the development of this industry and enhances life for millions of people. the condition of india in terms of healthcare has been quite grim. patients who need attention are neglected and are unable to avail proper treatment or diagnosis. however, with the coming up of digitization, there has been hoped for this industry also.
 
 
 
 according to dr. keshab panda, ceo & md, l&t technology services,
  there are three trends emerging in the healthcare and diagnostics ecosystem as a result of digitization.
 
 
 
 1. value-based healthcare
 
 
 
 this is a model of healthcare where doctors and hospitals are paid based on patient health outcomes. the coming up of digital tools in this segment of healthcare can be considered as the starting tool. dr. panda further says that the implementation of advanced digital technologies in patient-care domains like- mobile health apps, telehealth, wearables, and remote monitoring can help in enhancing accessibility, boost efficiency and augment the effectiveness of treatment and preventive care.
 
 
 
 2. new product development
 
 
 
 the healthcare industry over the past few decades has changed drastically. with the coming of emerging technologies, new surgical procedures and medical devices have been made available.
 
 
 
 3. connectivity
 
 
 
 while talking about connectivity in healthcare, dr. panda said that with digitization taking over the industry, it is only a matter of time when with the help of the internet and smartphones, digital healthcare will be everywhere. the internet for once has helped doctors connect to their patients and also with one another. this has helped in enhancing the doctor-patient engagement by increasing their interaction time.
 
 
 
 big data aggregates information about a business through formats such as social media, ecommerce, online transactions, and financial transactions, and identifies patterns and trends for future use.
 
 
 
 for the healthcare industry, big data can provide several important benefits, including:
 
 
 
 
 lower rate of medication errors – through patient record analysis, the software can flag any inconsistencies between a patient’s health and drug prescriptions, alerting health professionals and patients when there is a potential risk of a medication error.
 facilitating preventive care – a high volume of people stepping into emergency rooms are recurring patients also called “frequent flyers.” they can account for up to 28% of visits. big data analysis could identify these people and create preventive plans to keep them from returning.
 more accurate staffing – big data’s predictive analysis could help hospitals and clinics estimate future admission rates, which helps these facilities allocate the proper staff to deal with patients. this saves money and reduces emergency room wait times when a facility is understaffed.
 
 
 
 
 challenges  for future digitalization of healthcare
 
 
 
  1. cybersecurity
 
 
 
 although ransomware, data breaches, and other cybersecurity concerns are nothing new to the healthcare industry, the 2020 covid-19 pandemic revealed just how vulnerable sensitive patient health information really is.
 
 
 
 the recent growth of digital health initiatives- like telehealth doctor visits — is a major contributor to the severe increase in breached patient records. as more healthcare functions continue to move online over the next year, it’s extremely important to ensure these processes are protected from outside threats.
 
 
 
 2. invoicing and payment processing:
 
 
 
 medical practices are citing patient collections as their top revenue cycle management struggle as patients are becoming responsible for a larger portion of their medical bills. in order to help encourage patients to submit payments in a timely manner, providers must adhere to patient payment preferences.
 
 
 
 to meet patient expectations and improve the user experience, ensure billing statements are patient-friendly. you should offer paperless statements and a variety of payment options (e.g. credit card, etc.) via an online patient portal and utilize the latest payment technologies, such as mobile and text-to-pay. new features like text or email reminders help effectively communicate with patients and encourage them to pay their financial obligations.
 
 
 
 3. patient experience
 
 
 
 the medical insurance landscape has experienced some significant changes in recent years. as more patients are responsible for a larger portion of their healthcare bill, they naturally demand better services from their providers.
 
 
 
 healthcare organizations will face tougher competition in attracting and retaining patients who demand an experience that matches the level of customer service they expect from other consumer brands.
 
 
 
 they demand a streamlined patient experience so they can “self-service” to resolve most questions, issues, or concerns (e.g., downloading an immunization record, booking an appointment, paying their bills, or checking their account/insurance status) whenever, wherever, and however is most convenient for them.",60,19,0.518987335202692,0.11366906474820145,6.813725490196078,0.11949694699873216,2.7732889748779246,83.05037816411885,695,2.9928057553956835,0,7.38705035971223

24136.6,"imagine yourself as a being who can speak but no one can comprehend you. you are kept in captivity, in a place where you can hardly breathe. you are finally selected and taken out of that place, it is a happy moment for you. you can finally have your freedom but sadly instead of being free, you are prodded by rods and fed toxic substances against your will. the only thing you can do is scream in vain. your voice is heard by everyone but it gets lost in the noise of scientific advancement. you writhe in pain as the substances take effect on your body, the pain slowly creeps into your body and you slowly succumb to it, never to wake up again.      since the time of aristotle, animals have been subjected to various inhumane experiments for the sake of knowledge. these experiments though unethical were very necessary for the advancement of science. animal testing has become an important part of experimenting on living organisms to ensure that a product is safe for humans to consume. the lab animals are generally subjected to high levels of toxicity while being kept in isolation due to which they have to suffer a lot of stress and discomfort. animal testing has a large number of drawbacks:    animals and human beings react differently to certain substances. for example, in 2004, vioxx withdrew “rofexocib” after more than 80,000 people suffered heart attacks after taking the drug. although the drug showed no such effects during animal testing, it posed threat to human beings. it is very costly to conduct animal testing as animals need to be provided with shelter and food over a large period until the trials are completed. animal testing might not lead to a scientific breakthrough. there are various instances of animal testing failing to achieve the desired result which ultimately leads to loss of time, resources and money. some products like cosmetics may not be essential to humans and therefore don’t require animal testing at all. the cosmetic industry is notorious for animal testing of products and it’s a pity that some of those products aren’t even launched in the market.    all of these things make us question ourselves. is it even worth it? is it possible to stop this cruelty without hampering our growth?    with the advancement in science, it can be made possible that we don’t have to use animals ever again.      advanced computing– with the availability of various software programs it has become easier to understand the working of a biological organism. we can replicate the entire human body and conduct various tests to get generate simulations to assess the possible effects of a chemical or biological reaction. for example, cadd (computer-aided drug design) is becoming popular for stimulating whether a particular drug affects the cells or not. this cuts down the requirement of using animals for testing and also reduces the experimentation time as the researchers don’t have to wait for the animals to show response. tissue culture – growing tissues in petri dishes and in vitro cells can be a viable alternative to animal testing. tissues and cells from brain, liver, kidney etc. is taken from an animal and kept in a suitable growth medium for a few weeks or even for a year. these cultures can be used to test the toxicity and efficacy of substances. for example: in eye irritancy tests, new animals have to be used in each experiment to check if the substance is irritating the eye or not. many animals permanently lose their eyesight and using a new animal every time is just simply inhumane. using bovine corneal organ culture in which the corneal tissue is cultured for three weeks before using it yields the same result without any complications. scientists have started to use this method to test for toxicity and efficacy in cosmetics, drugs and chemical sectors. 3-d printing– making complex tissue structures from a single digital file is astonishing. printing tissues can help in carrying out experiments on it and getting results similar to the real tissues. for example earlier animal organs, charts and 3-d models were used to explain the functioning of a particular organ to medical students but now bio-printing companies have started making human tissues and organs which are used by students in various medical schools to understand the intricacies of human organs which has helped in bringing down animal experimentation to a large extent.    these bio-printed models can also be used by the researchers to conduct experiments on them without using animals for it. a french company is working on a bio-printed liver model to test liver toxicity without having to use animals at all. this is a breakthrough in the field of bio-technology as it can bring down animal experimentation by a large percentage.       organ-on-a-chip method – it is a fairly new technology which consists of growing cells inside chips where they imitate the structure and behavior of human organs. researchers can test drugs on these chips and it is far cheaper and humane than testing on animals. for example, uk company cn bio has come with a system which consists of 10 organs on a single chip and they have tissues ranging from the liver to the brain.micro dosing: humans can participate in these experiments in which they are injected with small one time doses and are constantly monitored under imaging techniques to gather information on the changes happening in the body. these tests can replace certain tests on animals and help in removing drug compounds that don’t have the desired effect on the human body. for example, covid-19 tests were carried on human volunteers in which they were given small doses of the vaccine and kept under constant surveillance. this helped the researchers in removing the drugs that were not having the desired effect on the human body and thus they were also able to remove animal testing as one of the processes.    these alternatives can help in bringing down animal experimentation to a large extent. if science can progress without harming animals then we should go for it rather than putting them through excruciating pain. we must protect the animals as much as we can or else we would soon be living in a world without them.",24,37,-0.21311475060467622,0.11030741410488246,5.421568627450981,0.05100479445067837,2.189029368760664,28.205651331225138,553,2.5406871609403257,1,6.531645569620253
24598.4,"introduction    the definition of consciousness has been controversial for centuries, hence it is given the title of the ‘most familiar and yet mysterious aspects of our lives’. an idea of this concept would be an awareness in beings of their surroundings, themselves, and their own perception. the reason this part of our mind remains unascertained is that consciousness isn’t observable, unlike brain matter that is studied scientifically. the physical clarification of awareness is in a general sense incomplete: it doesn’t include what it feels to be the subject, for the subject. there likewise is by all accounts an unbridgeable illustrative gap between the physical world and our consciousness. as suggested by an incident of eastern and shamir traditions, consciousness is both universal and primal. whilst we have made tremendous progress in understanding brain activity over the years, this research hasn’t been able to answer all the questions relating to the nature of emotions and experiences.    history    beginning within the late nineteenth century, this was a time that once had psychological queries driven by a philosophical understanding of the mind, which was typically equated with consciousness. as a result, the analysis of brain and behavior naturally thought of the role of consciousness in behavioral management by the brain.    the ancient mayans were among the first to propose a sorted out feeling of each degree of consciousness, its purpose, and its worldly association with mankind. since consciousness incorporates stimuli from nature as well as interior stimuli, the mayans trusted it to be the most essential type of existence, equipped for evolution. the incas, however, thought about consciousness as a movement of mindfulness as well as of worry for others too.    john locke, an early philosopher, said that consciousness, and so individuality, are freelanced of all substances. he also detected that there is no reason to believe that consciousness is stuck to any specific body or mind, or that consciousness cannot be transferred from one body or mind to a different one. karl marx, another early thinker, denies the mind-body classification and holds that consciousness is jeopardized by the material eventualities of one’s settings. william james, an american psychologist, differentiated consciousness to a stream – unbroken and continuous despite several changes and shifts.    while the main center of a lot of the analysis moved to strictly note cable behaviors throughout the primary half of the twentieth century, analysis of human consciousness has grown staggeringly after the 1950s.    in sigmund freud’s psychoanalytic theory, we can see that he believed that all three levels of awareness- preconscious, conscious, and unconscious were responsible for one’s behavior and thinking. he believed that the mid itself was divided into three parts- the id, the ego, and the superego. the id is present at birth, instinctual, and operates according to the pleasure principle. the ego underseals reality and logic and develops out of the id in infancy. finally, the superego is an internalization of society’s moral standards and responsible for guilt. now, the id is regarded as unconscious, whereas the ego and superego are also conscious and preconscious. freud constantly revised his own clinical qualities researches, however, and didn’t conduct scientific experiments and hence his work is heavily scrutinized, leaving the questions unanswered.      sigmund freud’s theory differed from the other psychologists since his theories were more understandable and very easily conveyed to the people. sigmund freud’s work and hypotheses helped people shape their perspectives on youth, character, memory, sexuality, and therapy. however, his theories were subject to considerable criticism both now and during his own life. whilst john locke and william james took a more practical approach to the mystery by conducting experiments, sigmund freud didn’t provide any evidence to support his claims.    brain    today, the essential focal point of consciousness research is on understanding what consciousness implies both biologically and mentally. issues of interest include phenomena such as perception, blindsight, brainwaves during sleep, and altered states of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugs.    a greater part of the test assesses consciousness by approaching human subjects for a verbal report of their encounters. however, to confirm the criticalness of these verbal reports, researchers must contrast them with the action that all the while happens in the brain —that is, they should search for the neural connections of consciousness.    hope is to locate that noticeable action in a specific aspect of the brain, or a particular pattern of global brain activity, will be greatly predictive of consciousness mindfulness. a few brain imaging strategies, for example, eeg and mri scans, have been utilized for physical proportions of brain activities in these examinations.    a few investigations have shown that movement in essential primary sensory areas of the brain isn’t adequate to create consciousness: it is workable for subjects to report an absence of awareness in any event, when areas, for example, the primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions to a stimulus. higher brain areas are viewed as all the more encouraging, particularly the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in a range of high order functions.    one mainstream theory implicates various examples of brain waves in creating various conditions of consciousness. analysts can record mind waves, or drawings of electrical movement inside the cerebrum, using an electroencephalograph (eeg) and placing electrodes on the scalp. the four types of brain waves (alpha, beta, theta, and delta) each correspond with one mental state (relaxed, alert, lightly asleep, and deeply asleep)    memory    episodic memory can be regarded as the only form of conscious memory. this is because it is the capacity to consciously remember personally experienced events and situations in the past. the hippocampus located in the brain’s temporal lobe is responsible for this type of memory.    consciousness also plays a part in important memory distinctions. one such distinction is the implicit and explicit characteristics; in which explicit memory is what you consciously know and implicit memory includes events you may not be conscious of.    furthermore, several empirical findings suggest that declarative memory is related to consciousness as well; meaning that the retrieval and formation of this memory are connected to awareness. working memory operates/maintains consciously perceived information as well since it temporarily stores and tampers with information whilst working on tasks.    the current ways of testing this information are lacking in several essential aspects, including spatial resolution, temporal resolution, or scope. examples of such methods are pet, fmri, eeg, implanted electrodes, etc.    pet and fmri have temporal resolution problems, eeg is well-known to have localizability difficulties, and implanted electrodes whilst great in temporal and spatial resolution can only test a set number of neurons; that is, they are restricted in scope. hence, huge numbers of our speculations, while testable on a fundamental level, appear to be difficult to test as of now.    mental illness    consciousness has an influence on the way we see objects around us, which encourages us to settle on choices about how to communicate with them. experiencing difficulty perceiving objects is connected to a few problems, for example, agnosia (a failure to decipher visual data), alzheimer’s disease, and autism. however, we actually don’t comprehend what visual data is basic for the mind to intentionally perceive an object.    several different disorders of consciousness include locked-in syndrome, minimally conscious state, persistent vegetative state, chronic coma, and brain death.    locked-in syndrome, otherwise called pseudo coma, is a condition wherein a patient is aware however can’t move or impart verbally because of complete loss of motion of essentially all voluntary muscles in the body aside from vertical eye developments and squinting. the individual is conscious and is able to speak with eye movements.    in a minimally conscious state, the patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness. patients need to give restricted, however reproducible indications of consciousness of themself or their current circumstance. this could be following straightforward orders, comprehensible speech, or purposeful conduct.    in a persistent vegetative state, the patient has sleep-wake cycles, but lacks awareness, is not able to communicate, and only displays reflexive and non-purposeful behavior. the term refers to an organic body that is able to grow and develop devoid of intellectual activity or social intercourse    like coma, chronic coma results generally from cortical or white-matter harm after neuronal or axonal injury, or from central brainstem sores. usually, the metabolism in the grey matter decreases to 50-70% of the normal range. the patient lies with eyes shut and doesn’t know about self or environmental factors.    brain death is the irreversible end of all brain activity, and function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life). the main cause is total necrosis of the cerebral neurons following loss of brain oxygenation. after brain death the patient lacks any sense of awareness; sleep-wake cycles or behavior, and typically look as if they are dead or are in a deep sleep state.    future predictions and conclusion    as we can see from the history of scholar’s endeavors to study consciousness empirically, its nature is not one that can be defined using scientific methods. in the past, psychologists such as descartes came up with dualistic theories that did not line up with the fundamental laws of physics. in the battle between realists and illusionists, taking sides is fundamentally impossible as the topic doesn’t allow for concrete evidence.    as we can observe from neural examinations of the brain to detect the causes of consciousness, there is no sensory sector of the brain that is the cause for one to be aware during a certain event even if there are clear signs of a reaction to a stimulus. similarly, even though consciousness plays a major role in memory, we currently lack the facilities to research it fully. in the future, there is a possibility that we will be able to access such facilities, however, which could allow us to find the neural connections and its ties to mental illness as well. not only would this help several people by making us aware of the causes of our perspective on certain things, but it would also give us a better chance of recognizing signs of possible mental illness or other issues beforehand.    as it seems, researchers continue to study this unknown part of our mind and once we are able to fund and recover from the global pandemic, we will be able to answer one of psychology’s most difficult questions.",34,49,-0.18072288938888087,0.08556701030927835,9.509803921568627,0.19673277859547367,3.8826146800656405,190.83079523760946,970,2.9237113402061854,5,7.252577319587629
25060.2,"nature has blessed humanity with earth, a rounded globe where all essential necessity lies in the hand of a human. though in this 21st-century building space shuttle and exploring space has become an obvious activity among the human raise, now with the inclusion of start-ups like space x once dreamed for reaching out at space now is coming true. we all have to agree upon a fact that in the growth of industrialization we have generated a humungous carbon footprint and colonize at outer space will create a much-needed area for our survival.    with time the human race has visualized and has undergone many transformations, and these transformations may for starters were not that effective but were a major role at existence to this age. be it a natural transformation like shifting of tectonic plates or manmade like dumping water and damaging water bodies, somehow have affected usual life of humans so creating space of humans is what next humans are eyeing for.    all this idea for colonizing in outer space emerged when nasa was able to launch a space shuttle with a heavy payload in the late 1990s this idea didn’t stir brain at that time but later was like apple eyes when various articles from astronauts and their writeup came into limelight and this idea saw its progression, space exploration was not a new normal, companies were petrified by the number of investments that these kinds of projects ask for. but things change with the entry of paypal’s owner elon musk, in 2002 where he laid stones of space x, with nasa providing the launchpad for their exploration.    being space travel legitimate there where many bottlenecks knowing the nature of outer space will boost the idea of colonizing, here one has to realize the optimum. but the main target that these company put forward with themself was to not just get into other planet but to get back at earth safely, earlier these projects due to high fund was always subdued and priority was given to the rocket technology. thus, this unimaginable quest for the search of space was far-fetched though.    now being in 2020 we do not find it out of a place of colonizing outside of space, the kind of emergence of technologies has led to the escalation of spreading the roots of human existence, the plan for reaching out to outer space too plays a key role for this idea too. proper planning, analysing, organising, and executing were required for these projects to be successful for deeper know how i would like to mention here an example of space x, according to them they wud be successful for sending rockets by 2022 and would able to colonize by 2050, for achieving these vision they have planned a total of 36 times pre-launch of the same rocket which they will be launching by 2020. not only that they have already placed their star link satellites which will provide the basic network connectivity for their colonized world, they have planned this to that extent that they have targeted a profit of $ 22 billion yearly by 2025. already they have sent the first manned rocket successfully what elon musk plan is to create that infrastructure by which going to mars with cost as a regular air flight ticket all this will lead to better chances for colonizing at another planet. with setting up their commercial flight once started to the red planet it wud just be a stepping stone for the colonizing at the outer space.    but the fundamental change that people have to undergo while living on another planet will be a change in gravity and being able to be near to live support if any technical issues arise to their suit until unless we find a similar place like the earth that is the change which humans have to adjust. aspects like ultraviolet rays too will play an immense role in the survival, but with the rate of technology expanding and challenging at very boundaries there are not many days left when we find solutions to these aspects but this idea of colonizing has more to do with monetary terms it has been projected that building a colony at space will cost at about $10 trillian which is more than many countries gdp. placing that much of an amount and getting funding for such highly anticipated projects is tough. elon to have addressed with these questions with an open door he believes that this cost is nothing when we find a route to colonize space and these costs will be justifiable when space exploration will reach new heights.    also, our world is around water and the percentage of land comparison to water is too less. whereas the population is increasing with the speed and the level of excitement in order to search for new things and the obsession with the new and innovative things never going to finish. because in the end, we do not satisfy what we have achieved, we are only looking for other things and crave to achieve that.    in order to achieve that planning is most crucial stage. as of now we have searched 9 planets but still didn’t shortlisted the outcomes. but according to the 3-decade theory of elon musk, it seems to be possible.    as the most important thing to survive is the atmospheric environment, whether is this suitable or not, and in order to make it suitable what steps had to take and maintain the suitable level of oxygen.  the missions are now what everyone is focusing about. finding the source of water, because its 2nd crucial thing which is needed to survive.    apart from the excitement and the things, the threats or the uncertainties are bound to happen like any kind of mammal which could occur during construction or after that. so the security for that or any protection so that uncertainties could be replicated.    after the basic things, other factors like what are the natural habitats available there, whether the plants could be grown over there or not. if yes, then what types of plants could survive there.    the environment for the animals is safe or not. because to balance the nature we need all types of animals, natural habitat, even insects and other small things which seems to be ignorable but plays an important role in maintaining the environmental balance. for e.g.  – ants are among the leading predators of other insects, helping to keep pest populations low.  ants move approximately the same amount of soil as earthworms, loosening the soil in the process and increasing air and water movement into the ground.  they keep the ecosystem clean of dead insect carcasses and aid in the destruction and decomposition of plant and animal matter. so, every small thing contributes in its own way.    another matter of concern is the level of artificial intelligence and machine learning required to maintain that kind of requirement. because as the current scenario, we need energy to run any vehicle or even for the robotics. so, the availability of the energy and the source of energy is needed.    and apart from this, the heat of sun is equally important in order to maintain the level. because with artificial air we can survive but not for so long. so, in order to remain healthy as well the calculation has to be done. when thinking about disease, you may have heard in the news about the concern that antibiotics (such as penicillin) – which help fight infections – may eventually stop working. global health organisations are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics, especially for conditions that aren’t serious. this is because their overuse in recent years means that they’re becoming less effective.    but still we can survive without antibiotics. because there are ways of dealing with diseases caused by bacteria such as isolation which is how they were treated before penicillin.    it might sound like something set firmly in the realm of fantasy, but experts in private industry and governments around the world are trying to understand how feasible it would be to establish a lunar base. some scientists think humans could survive comfortably on the moon. in some ways, the very minimal gravity of the moon might actually be more conducive to life than the microgravity astronauts experience on the international space station.    although it hasn’t been formally tested, some experts hypothesize that the small amount of gravitational force put on an astronaut’s body when on the moon could help stem some of the adverse effects like bone-density and muscle loss that space flyers experience while living in microgravity on the international space station.    by using the moon’s indigenous material, space agencies can save money on the cost of flying pricey missions to and from the moon’s surface. once on the moon, instead of having to stage costly missions aimed at delivering oxygen and other necessary resources from earth, experts might be able to actually use the material to manufacture gasses needed to sustain life on the satellite.    on earth, we are protected from radioactive solar winds and cosmic rays by our own magnet field known as the magnetosphere. but out in the space, we can’t rely on this type of protection, and in order to make that protection, it could take a lot but yes with more upgraded technology it could achieve.    although till now the approximate value of the project is $10 trillion. but the aim is to make the fare equivalent to the normal air fare.    as once we are comfortable with all the resources, securities for uncertainties, risk analysis, and the probability of survival of the human being and many other factors after consideration, then development won’t take much time.    because to construct a building it take normally 8-9 months. which is totally acceptable.    but the main concern is the density of the land, i.e. whether the land has the capacity to bear that much weight or not. and the type of land is adaptable for cultivation or nor. although land can be converted into different types of cultivation but with the help of upgraded technology.    in order to transport the equipments on the regular basis, a large amount of fuel is required, and other factors as well and built the propellor depo for rocket landing building various infrastructure for the city one by one will create a way forward for idea of colonizing at outer space.",57,22,0.4430379690754688,0.09090909090909091,8.519607843137255,0.08889407032832515,3.4434007653862317,77.24894711531455,869,2.6029919447640966,0,6.459148446490219
25522.0,"we’ve really done it this year. like an insatiable glutton, the law of averages has come home to roost. we should’ve taken the hint when on the 1st of january, 66 people lost their lives in the jakarta floods. what followed was like the highlights reel of a disaster movie franchise – a volcanic eruption in the philippines, irrepressible bushfires in australia, earthquakes in russia, iran, turkey, india, and china. and speaking of china.    2020 has brought home the fragile mortality of the human race into sharp focus. as global covid-19 deaths stoutly push past the grim 1 million marks, we have no choice but to question our place in the universe – are we the all-conquering masters of our domain, or mere tourists in a ruthlessly apathetic ecosystem? is the human race on the ubiquitous three-part literary arc that defines every story, every life, every civilization – ascent, apex, and descent? maybe when michael jackson unveiled his moonwalk in 1983, or when barack obama stepped into the white house as president of the united states in 2008, or indeed when ms dhoni lifted the cricket world cup in 2011, we peaked, as a species, and everything since then has been a steady unraveling.    500 years is a long time. for context, the world population in 1500 ad was a mere 461 million. the 16-fold explosion since then is unprecedented in history, but we might just be at the tip of an iceberg. though fertility rates are dropping and more and more people are foregoing the chance to have babies, we might just have crossed the threshold – the population projections for the year 2050 is 9.8 billion, and for 2100 is a whopping 11.2 billion1. somewhere out there, malthus is cackling in his grave. the year 2500 suddenly seems a long way off, and this conversation seems ever-more pertinent today. the bulletin of atomic scientists is not optimistic – the famed doomsday clock they maintain is the closest to ‘midnight’ (our proximity to global catastrophe), since its inception in 1947. global warming? check. the threat of nuclear war? check. ongoing pandemic? check, check, check.    and yet, hope floats, for three reasons. mankind may just have its back to the wall right now, but there are three shoots of potential that might just help us make it to 2500 ad – the advent of a basket of disruptive technologies (artificial intelligence, bio-enhancement, genetic engineering), the private sector focus on space exploration and terraforming, and good old fashioned human resilience. while the first two factors will no doubt be critical to human survival, it is the third one that we must pin our hopes on – our long-demonstrated history of surviving whatever nature, the universe, or our own self-destructive tendency, throws our way.    the next superman?    in the 13th century, in the italian town of pisa, an enterprising tinkerer developed the first eyeglasses, for a local friar with weakening eyesight2. all of a sudden, there existed an external device that could amplify our senses, a tool that gave us an advantage in survival. today, lasik surgeries obviate the need for eyeglasses entirely. hearing aids give the gift of auditory perception back to those who had gotten used to a world of muffled voices and unheard sounds. the iphone routinely comes with an augmented reality tool that allows us to measure the length of objects in front of us.    but the real science starts where the imagination ends – augmented reality glasses, smart wearables, and virtual reality tools will be ubiquitous in the next few decades. but what after that? science has the answer, and it’s both thrilling and scary. artificial intelligence has become the stuff of fable, the filler for all questions left unanswered. but ai, combined with bio-enhancement and genetic engineering, might just lead to the evolution of what some are calling homo nouveau3. homo nouveau will be smarter, faster, more agile, and better equipped to adapt to what promises to be a world that is vuca beyond our imaginations. what might such a human being look like?    they might have a small chip embedded in their brain that utilizes artificial intelligence for enhanced sensory perception. what does that mean? it means that they would be able to see better, focuses their attention for longer, hears what they want to hear, and communicate the appropriate reaction to the rest of the body. through a chemical in the blood, this ai chip would be able to demand the appropriate response from the body. bio-augmentation of limbs and organs, internal and external, would mean that what a person can or cannot do is no longer determined at birth, but can simply be bought. all of a sudden, the average joe can run faster than usain bolt, swim better than michael phelps, and…fly? maybe. genetic engineering will be the missing link. already there are feverish conversations about a dystopian future featuring designer babies and a digital divide that simply cannot be overcome because it is inbuilt into one’s dna. the breakthrough with crispr-cas9 might just be the key to unlock the mysteries of dna manipulation. so what if there’s no food left? our body ai will adjust our appetite accordingly. no water? absorb humidity from the air through specialized pores in the skin. the human being in 2500 ad may not be how we recognize one today. that may be our only shot.    galactic dominance    spacex, led by its mercurial leader elon musk, has been the leader here. the spacex mars programme is based on a very simple premise – as the earth’s closest planet in terms of distance and terrestrial conditions, mars would be our best bet for colonization. musk has invested billions of dollars in the mars space programme and remains a fervent believer in the concept. and among tech visionaries, musk is not alone. jeff bezos, the richest man in the world, owns blue origin, which simply aims to make spaceflight cheaper through incremental technological growth. bezos, who took an online retailer of books and turned it into an ever-expanding behemoth, is not a man who thinks small. with more and more business leaders finding spaceflight and planetary colonization a tantalizing prospect, there will inevitably be a concerted push to developing an actual colony on another planet. and when the pull-factor to this development starts hitting diminishing returns, there will be the inevitable push factor as global warming and the possible increase in the eruption of pandemics begin to take their toll. it might just become a more feasible option for people to find an alternate home, if not on mars, then on one of saturn’s moons.    a human colony on mars sounds like a concept straight out of science fiction, but so did a permanent station in antarctica until a few decades ago. mount everest seemed like an unapproachable summit until someone went ahead and planted a flag at the peak. today, hundreds of people every year attempt the climb. as spaceflight becomes more reasonable, as the urge to explore supersedes the inertia of investment, we become closer to our best chance of survival – leaving planet earth behind and finding another home, perhaps one more forgiving of our follies.    the human spirit    the introduction to this article includes an illustrative list of disasters and misfortunes that have struck the global community this year. and yet, we survive. businesses surge ahead, people adapt to a world of masks and social distancing, the world goes on. earthquakes, tsunamis, pandemics, we’ve seen them all before and survived, and the human race, in its intrepid exploration of the world, pushes onward and upward. technological visionaries envision a future that the rest of us cannot see, and then invest money in their vision. gradually, what seemed unthinkable suddenly becomes real – the moon landing is the best possible example of that. google launched google glass as the first augmented reality wearable technology, and suddenly we could foresee a future with smart eyewear. while the product didn’t quite catch on, that doesn’t mean other companies aren’t trying. bio-augmentation is already a fast-developing industry, while crispr-cas9, the “genetic scissors” is being held back only by regulatory bottlenecks. how long before the prospect of fiddling with the gene code becomes not a luxury but a necessity? the human spirit, the tendency to survive and thrive at all costs, will eventually win.    the human race will survive to 2500, of that there is no doubt. the real question is, will the person who exists in 2500, with bionic chips and a bio-enhanced body structure and a modified genetic code, be called a homo sapien? or is homo nouveau the way forward?",52,26,0.3333333290598291,0.09762202753441802,7.833333333333333,0.08160767112108537,3.1659764017817675,65.20452922574721,799,2.569461827284105,5,6.3842302878598245
25983.8,"mr. sakamoto is a bonsai artist, lives downtown kyoto, japan. bonsai is a japanese art form that is the cultivation of small trees in a small or medium container. he is in this field of business for the last ten years and he loves what he does on a daily basis. people from different cities in japan, come to buy his artwork. but, in the early stage of his business, he was just another regular bosai artist. his popularity has increased because of the stories he tells for every art he is selling. his customer immediately loved him for this while buying a bonsai art. he loved to sell his customer with his artwork and a story related to that product which resurrects his presence through his art in customers. soon enough his business thrived and nowadays he is always busy. after the digital revolution, although his sales increased, he was not happy. he was not satisfied. something is eating up his mind day by day. he could not understand what’s the reason behind his remorse.    a chatbot is an awesome invention of the digital revolution. it is the real-life embodiment of customer engagement. every business needs this feature- will be an understatement. because customer engagement is the base of any business. the chatbot does the exact thing digitally. it helps customers to answer the queries and tell about the product that the business has to offer is a fully automated way with vibrant customizations.                    mr. sakamoto is running his business for the last fifteen years now. and now he is happy that he was not for the past couple of years. the rationale behind his happiness is the chatbot. though he has a website and app to sell his bonsai art, he could not engage with the customers in the way he wanted to. he has trained his employees and apprentices, but they are not providing the same service in the way he does. he was unsatisfied and the chatbot relives him from his sadness. he has done all that at affordable prices in no time.    let’s understand the mr. sakamoto’s “mondai nai”- perspective about why chatbot is the answer of his problems.    building the trust with customers    this is the fundamental and root cause for which mr. sakamoto has to implement the chatbot in the first place. his stories are embedded with each art. the product which he sells needs this story to be with it. his stories which were not been told to all the customers before are now sharing with this chatbot and building the trust between them. we all can agree on this one statement that trust is the most impactful aspect, maybe the best of aspects, in the relation between any customer and business-owner, whether the business is small, medium, or large.    target the millennial customer    millennials, a word that was not introduced before 1990. the generation which is stuck in between gen-x and gen-y. a generation of people accustomed to both digitization and old culture. they are the most targeted audience in this era. what else would be more approachable to this generation than a chatbot? it’s easy, less time consuming to use. mr. sakamoto is now one of the few gen-x persons who can do business with the millennial so easily.    better human interactions    mr. sakamoto has some employees and apprentices. he has trained them as per his needs. but there is a limit. they can’t deliver the exact things that he can or the way he does. neither chatbot can do that exactly, it will accurately follow the instructions. not only the chatbot solve the queries of the customer in his way, but also give a recommendation to the product in the way he wants too. is there any more attribute he would care about that? absolutely no!    24*7 service    the most expensive thing for any businessman is the return of their customer with an empty hand because of his unavailability. a chatbot is a perfect way to solve it. for mr. sakamoto’s customized chatbot is not only present for customers in their availability, but also it was giving the response to the customer in all the time zone, all over the world. mr. sakamoto wouldn’t be happier for this feature.    scaling up business in globalization    in the era of globalization, what is more, helpful than a chatbot? it can be customized in any language. it can be accessed by any human being residing in any part of the world. and at the end of the day, when that foreigner is happy with the buy and the felicitation and says “arigato” but in his own language, at that moment he feels so warm and happy.    handling a lot of customers is really hard. he assigned employees, but the rate is growing fast. so, in the competition of the market, mr. sakamoto took the help of a chatbot. now this automated customized application is handling a greater number of customers than his employees can do. his business is growing exponentially.    now, when you found out why mr. sakamoto is happy and his business is growing in this competitive industry then, do you still have a question in mind that why does your business need a chatbot?",28,7,0.5999999828571434,0.08951406649616368,3.8333333333333335,0.03643199603619883,1.5479061317478129,14.244910450153743,391,2.6342710997442453,0,6.549872122762149
26445.6,"have you ever wondered what’s common between sir alex ferguson, pep guardiola, and jose mourinho? i know it might look a lame question, especially to the ardent football followers. at first instinct, the answer is that they are regarded as the top managers in the football universe. #uclwinners. but when given a closer look, these managers, weren’t that great when it came to their careers as football players. any naïve observer can build a fallacy of causation and correlation that those who don’t have a great career as a football player will go on to become a great football manager. but is this restricted just to football? mike brearley, one of the greatest captains in the history of cricket and the author of the book the art of captaincy, wasn’t the prolific batsman of his time. our former president, a p j abdul kalam didn’t have a political background, but was still appointed as the president of our country and went to become one of the finest presidents our country has ever had. so, can it be stated with confidence that great leaders need not be the expert in their respective fields?let’s understand the leadership role, types of leaders, and explore a few more perspectives before we arrive at a conclusion.     let’s start by first understanding what or who is a leader. a leader is not a position or a designation. it’s a virtue if employed correctly. from a janitor to the ceo, from a student to a researcher, from a content writer to a philosopher everybody is a leader. (#leadersareeverywhere) so, what are the virtues of a leader? one of the famous personality trait theories, the big 5 personality trait theory is always linked closely with leadership. as per the various researches, the personality traits of extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness are associated with leaders more often than the other two traits. not just these humble and empathetic are also considered as the adjectives that are frequently associated with leaders. but nowhere is technical expertise related to a leader. #notsotechnical    as stated by colin powell leadership is the art of accomplishing more than the science of management says is possible. #it’sart if leadership is an art and leaders are the artists then more or less the leaders can be viewed as directors of the films who are organizing, arranging, managing, and directing the scenes. another analogy for that can be the orchestra where the conductor is using the baton/stick to set the rhythm of the band. so, is it necessary for the conductor to himself or herself by a great violinist? no. when it comes to the corporate sector the leader need not be an expert on the technology but should know how the technology functions so that he/she can utilize it in the best possible way. they can allocate the task of building technology to the right technical experts. and how do the leaders identify the right person for that job? or how do leaders know what qualities to look for in a person? #experience. every great leader once started off as one of the frontline workers or at the bottom of the pyramid in the hierarchical structure. even though they might not have had the technical expertise in their respective fields, their visionary outlook, their management skills, and the experience they gathered helped them in achieving their targets. leaders can always take the assistance of the subject matter experts to guide them in situations of technical difficulties. as per the great man, situational and trait theory of leadership, leadership is innate to the person. leadership though can be conditioned or can be brought out in a person by rewarding him, great leaders show unconditional attachment towards their vision. everyone knows how to read a map, but which path to choose isn’t something that can be taught. leaders give the direction or vision to the company and drive it closer to the target that the company wants to achieve. leadership theories don’t focus on the technical knowledge of the leaders, but rather more on people skills, their approach towards a problem, and how well they guide and hire others to get the job done, which is also evident as per the managerial skills required as per robert katz.        though it can be argued that technical experts are also the great leaders in their areas, but these leaders are generally at the middle management level. as per the different leadership styles, a servant leader is the one who always tries to achieve the goal of the team. these leaders are the ones who have a management objective laid out in front of them and they drive the team closer to achieving the target by having the people-first mindset, a collaborative approach towards solving the problem. these are the people or the leaders needed at the execution level of the project or those who are too close to the employees at the bottom-most level. since the managers at the top of the pyramid don’t get much time to invest in people they appoint the right people on their behalf to get the job done.      consider an it firm. so as per the points mentioned above, does it mean that a leader or the manager shouldn’t know how to code? depends. if the person is the first line manager then he or she should probably know how to code so that he or she can help the team in achieving the target of producing less garbage which might be one of the project’s kpis. the project manager, who might be an operations manager, (#mba) from an it background, probably need not know what line of code is to be written but should know the algorithms or the logic behind the code so that he or she can validate the code from the client’s perspective. the ceo, might not be from an it background but should know how to run an it firm rather than the syntax of the code.    but in today’s competitive world leaders can’t be one dimensional. they need to have expertise in multiple areas to be at the top. mike brearley if got a chance to play a t20 match, won’t even get picked into aside, not because of his age, but because of his not so great looking batting statistics(#thegamehaschanged). his leadership skills won’t be enough to get him into the squad. but he can be a great leader if selected to coach the top 15 captains in the world today. as we have already discussed the film directors, their job isn’t to teach the cameramen on how to set up or operate (lens settings, etc) the camera. their job is to guide the cameramen on what angle it should be held and how he or she should coordinate with the lights crew so that a perfect shot is captured. so even if a leader may not be a technical expert of his field, but if he or she has the right approach and mindset, understands the system and its process, then he or she can hire the best talent for the job and can get the work done by guiding the talent, with his or her vision.        so, the answer to the question, which we came across in the first paragraph, is yes and no. depending upon the position in the hierarchy (yes for a front-line manager and no for a cxo) and the type of the leader you are, the level of technical expertise needed varies. though as stated earlier by robert katz, the cxo’s need to have the least amount of technical expertise, the cxo should know how the technology functions or what are the applications. what processes are to be followed to build the technology.  he or she should now what is to be done rather than how it is to be done, (#itsnothowitswhat). otherwise, even though the company might be sitting on a gold mine but if the leader isn’t aware of that or isn’t learned enough to know what to do with it, no company can succeed even with having all the resources at their disposal. leaders command respect and don’t demand it and that’s possible when they give value to their front-line employees, seek timely advice from the technical experts, and put the resources to the best of its uses. otherwise, you will be surrounded by technical experts like dilberts.

26907.4,"the word “leadership” can bring to mind a variety of images. for example, a political leader, pursuing a passionate, personal cause or an executive, developing his/her company’s strategy to beat the competition. leaders help themselves and others to do the right things. they set direction, build an inspiring vision, and create something new. leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to “win” as a team or an organization; and it is dynamic, exciting, and inspiring.    in my point of view we cannot become a good leader without technical expertise because every task in the organization it’s required a lot of skills, knowledge, consistent, enthusiastic, patience, motivating, inspiring, industrious, and critical thinking on the basis of the field we are doing. a leader should have the ability to motivate self and others, effective oral and written communication, critical thinking skills at the working team and delegating a task. good leaders do have these abilities and if we wanted to create a future leader. they need to take in a large volume of information and to take the essential elements that define the core problem to solve. they need to organize a team to solve these problems and to communicate to a group, they need to established trust with a group and use the trust to allow the team to accomplish the work more than it could be done alone. though all these skills we have but it’s would not sufficient to make us a great leader because to excel and utilize these abilities in practice we need a lot of technical expertise in a particular domain. for example, like in a hospital if the head of the hospital is lead by other people rather than doctor then the hospital would become worse at a point because the person from other fields he could not lead and understand the real scenario and mechanism that the hospital is functioning and he would not understand the staff and the patient as well. hence, to lead the hospital doctor is deserved who knows his own field how to lead and understand the real scenario of it. that’s why being a leader requires technical expertise to have great knowledge and understanding about his own organization. every person if they want to become a leader they should have technical expertise on their own organization so that their organization would run smoothly, hence nobody could run other organization if we do not have the technical expertise on that field.    so, be a leader, not a boss which makes your life much better, as they’re a saying that “ a good objective of leadership is to help those who are doing poorly to do well and to help those who are doing well to do even better.”",37,6,0.7209302157923206,0.1902654867256637,2.215686274509804,0.021859197621719298,0.8950181888526094,4.940178662508561,226,2.663716814159292,1,6.54424778761062
27369.2,"when we talk about ai, different people have different perspectives about it. there is one group of people, having good knowledge about the real potential of ai, who believe that ai can be a novel solution to many problems that the world is facing today. there is another group of people who are merely threatened by the thought of ai taking over the world.    the field of ai took birth when alan turing in 1950 had this thought “can machines think?”. later in the 1980s, with the adoption of “expert systems” by the companies around the world, the booming of the field of ai was initiated. initially, it was a matter of awe for everyone to see the results of what ai can achieve. ai’s growth in the past few decades has been exponential and it has transformed the way we live, work and solve challenges. ai has made its impact in a wide variety of areas including healthcare, education, business and many more. but, one of the areas of highest impact that ai has made recently is in the environment and climate change.    is ai revolutionizing the way we deal with environment and climate change?    ai can strengthen climate predictions, enable smarter decision-making for decarbonising industries from building to transport, and work out how to allocate renewable energy. in recent years, ai has been a game-changer in how many people, as well as organizations, deal with climate change. microsoft believes that artificial intelligence, often encompassing machine learning and deep learning, is a “game-changer” for climate change and environmental issues. the company’s ‘ai for earth’ program has committed $50 million over five years to create and test new applications for ai.    ai is increasingly used to manage the intermittency of renewable energy so that more can be incorporated into the grid; it can handle power fluctuations and improve energy storage as well. wind companies are using ai to get each turbine’s propeller to produce more electricity per rotation by incorporating real-time weather and operational data.    ai can also improve energy efficiency on the city scale by incorporating data from smart meters and the internet of things (the internet of computing devices that are embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data) to forecast energy demand. besides, artificial intelligence systems can simulate potential zoning laws, building ordinances, and flood plains to help with urban planning and disaster preparedness. one vision for a sustainable city is to create an “urban dashboard” consisting of real-time data on energy and water use and availability, traffic and weather to make cities more energy-efficient and livable.    hotter temperatures will have significant impacts on agriculture as well. data from sensors in the field that monitor crop moisture, soil composition and temperature help ai improve production and know when crops need watering. incorporating this information with that from drones, which are also used to monitor conditions, can help increasingly automatic ai systems know the best times to plant, spray and harvest crops, and when to head off diseases and other problems. this will result in increased efficiency, enhanced yields, and lower use of water, fertilizer and pesticides.    but, is ai as good as it looks or does it have a downside?    when we talk about the effect of ai in the environment and climate, both sides of the coin must be elucidated. so, apart from all the positives discussed above, the usage of ai also has a downside.    last year’s world economic forum report showed that while ai can address some of earth’s environmental challenges, it is important to manage it properly. according to the forum and experts in the field, ai has the potential to accelerate environmental degradation. the use of power-intensive gpus to run machine learning training has already been cited as contributing to increased c02 emissions.    although ai has been around for about half a century, the question of environmental impact – and other ethical issues – is only arising now because the techniques developed over decades can now be used in combination with an explosion in data and strong computational power.    for all the advances enabled by artificial intelligence, from speech recognition to self-driving cars, ai systems consume a lot of power and can generate high volumes of climate-changing carbon emissions.    a study last year found that training an off-the-shelf ai language-processing system produced 1,400 pounds of emissions – about the amount produced by flying one person roundtrip between new york and san francisco. but there are ways to make machine learning cleaner and greener, a movement that has been called “green ai.” some algorithms are less power-hungry than others, for example, and many training sessions can be moved to remote locations that get most of their power from renewable sources.    the key, however, is for ai developers and companies to know how much their machine learning experiments are spewing and how much those volumes could be reduced.    what can be done?    to prevent this, the proposition by the world economic forum report is that advancements in “safe” ai should be pursued, to ensure that humanity is not developing ai that is harmful to the environment. specifically, the world economic forum said in its report that ai developers “must incorporate the health of the natural environment as a fundamental dimension.” this means safeguarding against models that will demand the consumption of energy or natural resources beyond what is sustainable, among other factors. in a sense, all programs need to be designed with the dimension of environmental protection and improvement in mind.    in the future development of ai programs, it will also be important to note the environmental impact of creating these systems in the first place. according to an academic study on energy usage for deep learning processes, the creation of an effective ai might be costly to the environment. nearly 300,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions are created during the process of training a single model. this is basically equal to the emissions of five average cars in the united states. considering the negative environmental impact in addition to the positive implications of ai and climate change will be crucial, moving forward.    there is always room for improvement, some pioneers of machine learning recently published a paper called tackling climate change with machine learning was discussed at a major ai conference. david rolnick, a postdoctoral fellow of the university of pennsylvania said “call to arms” which means to bring researchers together.    this paper covers thirteen areas of research where machine learning can be used, including energy production, co2 removal, education, solar geoengineering, finance and many more. the main idea is to build more energy-efficient buildings, creating new low-carbon materials, high tech monitoring of deforestation and greener transportation sources. artificial intelligence and machine learning can be a medium but the real work is to be done by us as a caretaker of mother earth.    how about better forecasting of climate change?     the kick start was already done by climate informatics in 2011 which regulates the collaboration of data science and climate science. it covers a wide range of topics like improving prediction of extreme events such as hurricanes, paleoclimatology, collecting data from ice cores, climate up-down scaling and its impact on us.    “there’s a lot of uncertainty,” monteleoni    claire monteleoni, a computer science professor at the university of colorado concludes that ai/ ml models generally forecast for the short-term. there is a significant difference when it comes to long-term forecasting.    the first system was developed at princeton in the 1960s. all the ai/ ml models developed till now revolve around atmosphere, oceans, land, cryosphere or ice. ai can help to achieve new heights with the amount of data collected at this point of time, and compute more complex climate conditions using climate modeling algorithms.    what about showing the effects of extreme weather?    we all know that climate change is real and the rise in atmospheric temperature the proof, but to make it more realistic, montreal institute of learning algorithms (mila), microsoft and conscientai labs uses generative adversarial networks popularly know as gans to simulate what mother earth will look like with the rising sea levels, atmospheric temperature, air pollution and intensive storms.    “our goal is not to convince people climate change is real, it’s to get people who do believe it is real to do more about that,” said victor schmidt, a co-author of the paper and ph.d. candidate at mila    the project is deployed for the people to look at what their places will look like in the future when there will be a significant climate change.    can we track carbon emissions?    short answer, yes. tracking of carbon emission is one of the agendas of the un. for this year 2020, the un’s goal is to prevent new coal plants from being built. satellite images come into picture using deep learning techniques, data science researchers can analyze these high quality satellite images and track the emission. google is expanding its horizon of nonprofit’s satellite imagery, including gas-powered plants emissions which can be used by researchers to track the pollution. there are countries organizations which govern co2 emission on the ground level but these data are unreachable by global monitoring associations.    ai can automate the analysis of images of power plants to get regular updates on emissions. it also introduces new ways to measure a plant’s impact, by crunching numbers of nearby infrastructure and electricity use. that’s beneficial for gas-powered plants that don’t have the easy-to-measure plumes that coal-powered plants have.",50,16,0.5151515073461893,0.07119741100323625,9.088235294117647,0.1311551857303158,3.6877561919391852,121.58085717200274,927,2.727076591154261,2,6.6235167206040995
27831.0,"no one can reduce mistakes to zero, but you can learn to harness your drive to prevent them and channel it into better decision making. use these tips to become a more effective worrier.    don’t be afraid or ashamed of your fear.     our culture glorifies fearlessness. the traditional image of a leader is one who is smart, tough, and unafraid. but fear, like any emotion, has an evolutionary purpose and upside. your concern about making mistakes is there to remind you that we’re in a challenging situation. a cautious leader has value. this is especially true in times like these. so don’t get caught up in ruminating: “i shouldn’t be so fearful.”    don’t be ashamed or afraid of your fear of making mistakes and don’t interpret it as evidence that you’re an indecisive leader, or not bold, not visionary. if you have a natural tendency to be prevention-focused, channel it to be bold and visionary! (if you struggle to believe this, identify leaders who have done just that by figuring out how to prevent disasters.)    use emotional agility skills.     fear of mistakes can paralyze people. emotional agility skills are an antidote to this paralysis. this process starts with labeling your thoughts and feelings, such as “i feel anxious i’m not going to be able to control my customers enough to keep my staff safe.” stating your fears out loud helps diffuse them. it’s like turning the light on in a dark room. next comes accepting reality. for example, “i understand that people will not always behave in ideal ways.” list off every truth you need to accept. then comes acting your values. let’s say one of your highest values is conscientiousness. how might that value apply in this situation? for example, it might involve making sure your employees all have masks that fit them well or feel comfortable airing any grievances they have. identify your five most important values related to decision-making in a crisis. then ask yourself how each of those is relevant to the important choices you face.    repeat this process for each of your fears. it will help you tolerate the fact that we sometimes need to act when the course of action isn’t clear and avoid the common anxiety trap whereby people try to reduce uncertainty to zero.    focus on your processes.     worrying can help you make better decisions if you do it effectively. most people don’t. when you worry, it should be solutions-focused, not just perseverating on the presence of a threat. direct your worry towards behaviors that will realistically reduce the chances of failure.    we can control systems, not outcomes. what are your systems and processes for avoiding making mistakes? direct your worries into answering questions like these: is the data you’re relying on reliable? what are the limitations of it? how do your systems help prevent groupthink? what procedures do you have in place to help you see your blind spots? how do you ensure that you hear valuable perspectives from underrepresented stakeholders? what are your processes for being alerted to a problem quickly and rectifying it if a decision has unexpected consequences?    broaden your thinking.     when we’re scared of making a mistake, our thinking can narrow around that particular scenario. imagine you’re out walking at night. you’re worried about tripping, so you keep looking down at your feet. next thing you know you’ve walked into a lamp post. or, imagine the person who is scared of flying. they drive everywhere, even though driving is objectively more dangerous. when you open the aperture, it can help you see your greatest fears in the broader context of all the other threats out there. this can help you get a better perspective on what you fear the most.    it might seem illogical that you could reduce your fear of making a mistake by thinking about other negative outcomes. but this strategy can help kick you into problem-solving mode and lessen the mental grip a particular fear has on you. a leader might be so highly focused on minimizing or optimizing for one particular thing, they don’t realize that other people care most about something else. find out what other people’s priorities are.    recognize the value of leisure.    fear grabs us. it makes it difficult to direct our attention away. this is how it is designed to work so that we don’t ignore threats. some people react to fear with extreme hypervigilance. they want to be on guard, at their command post, at all times. this might manifest as behavior like staying up all night to work.    that type of adrenalin-fueled behavior can have short-term value, but it can also be myopic. a different approach can be more useful for bigger picture thinking. we need leisure (and sleep!) to step back, integrate the threads of our thinking, see blindspots, and think creatively. get some silent time. although much maligned, a game of golf might be exactly what you need to think about tough problems holistically.    detach from judgment-clouding noise.     as mentioned, when people are fearful they can go into always-on monitoring mode. you may have the urge to constantly look at what everyone else is doing, to always be on social media, or check data too frequently. this can result in information overload. your mind can become so overwhelmed that you start to feel cloudy or shut down. recognize if you’re doing this and limit over-monitoring or over checking. avoid panicked, frenzied behavior.    on its own, being afraid of making mistakes doesn’t make you more or less likely to make good decisions. if you worry excessively in a way that focuses only on how bad the experience of stress and uncertainty feels, you might make do or say the wrong things. however, if you understand how anxiety works at a cognitive level, you can use it to motivate careful but bold and well-reasoned choices.",37,74,-0.33333333033033036,0.22424242424242424,4.852941176470588,0.03060287667040702,1.9534176212563983,15.148423951851475,495,2.597979797979798,1,6.397979797979798
28292.8,"what’s perfection really? does every person expect perfection from oneself or someone else? or is it in certain amounts? many times the certain question comes to the mind when we think about what we deem perfect. but how do we verify it?    let us understand this through the work of three individuals who know are to be put on a task in carpentry on a budget. all are given rs. 5000 (assumed) to complete this task. they can’t go beyond this budget.    manish, vinay, and sameer need to make a stool for themselves each. manish has no understanding of carpentry; he learns from youtube. vinay took his carpentry lessons during engineering, so he has a practical idea of how to make a stool. but sameer is a carpenter, so he has a total understanding of the material, process, and final product.    let us start with manish. understand that the task is to get their jobs done. manish has two options here. he can either order parts and assemble it himself or order the material required such as wood, glue, nails, etc and then work on it before the assembly of the final product. the only difference is his lack of expertise in this field.    vinay has the same options but has practical experience from his carpentry classes during the workshop in engineering. sameer has an advantage since he has both skill and experience perfected over a course of time.    all three are given three days for the task. since manish finds it easy to assemble the stool using parts procured from another carpenter; he talks to a carpenter he knows and orders 3 leg parts, 6 horizontal support bars, and one circular base which will sit on the top. vinay thinks he will be able to shape the parts because of his experience as a student and orders several cylindrical wooden leg parts, cuboidal bars, and a thick sheet. sameer has all the required material in his shop and he begins to work on the stool on the first day.    manish and vinay wait for a day for the parts to come. they begin to work on the second day. manish uses the tricks learned from youtube videos; uses a hammer to place the nails purchased from a nearby shop in the pre-made hole, applies glue in certain areas as directed in the video, and places weight on the assembled stool. he waits for the glue to cure.    vinay uses borrowed drill bits, drill machines, cutters, sandpapers purchased from a shop, etc, and starts working on the wooden parts as soon as the parts arrive in the morning. he is able to recall his carpentry instructions and attempts to shape the parts based on drawing of his product he made last night. sameer meanwhile has completed his assembly and has put the assembly to rest for the glue to cure.    on the third day, each of them has the stool ready. they evaluate their own work and notice certain facts.    manish notices that he did complete the task but, his stool was wobbly and not glued well. it could fall the moment he sits on it. also, he forgets to polish the wooden parts and give it a professional finish since he forgot to watch that bit of video over youtube.    vinay completes the task his stool is sturdy and cured well overnight. but there are minor issues with it. one of the three legs is cut short by a few mm and the stool, a tad unstable.    sameer on the other hand completes the task with a good product. the stool is well-balanced, and polished, as he expected from him. sameer is satisfied with his work and finds it to stool perfect. manish thinks he did his best considering he had no experience of the task to be done. he is satisfied with his work. but vinay is unhappy, he could have done better and made the product better. he doesn’t find his efforts well put and thinks he wasn’t productive enough and hence his stool is nowhere perfect.    understand that all of them had a set of skills and experience, but only sameer had the right skills and experience to produce a perfect product. manish and sameer were satisfied and happy with their work. manish made a wobbly stool which could break the moment someone sat on it but happy he gave the task a go. he thinks put the efforts and he did a good job. it was only vinay who could not overcome the fact that his work was not perfect.    in vinay’s case, it can be observed that he could not deliver what he learned from carpentry classes. the reason is simple, he put effort but didn’t have the experience. experience mattered. since vinay thinks otherwise, he believes he has the perfect skills to complete the task but he could not deliver the results. he is not satisfied with his results and wishes to spend another day working on the stool on his own to get to his idea of the perfect result.    in this case, the idea of perfection itself is misplaced. you see, the end product made by vinay and manish would not match sameer’s but the task could have been completed had they understood where their shortcomings lied. for both, it was their skill. sameer had the perfect skill to get the expected result which resulted in better productivity, others didn’t.    and in this story, every individual put effort regardless of the result. but some were satisfied and some dissatisfied. their satisfaction made their creations perfect in their eyes and dissatisfaction made one believe he wasn’t productive enough.      “perfection is subjective and productivity is utility extracted given a certain amount of effort”.    you can try to be as productive to achieve something but ultimately, it’s the satisfaction you get that defines the boundary of perfection. if you aren’t satisfied, you won’t find anything perfect. you would just waste both your time and effort over something that doesn’t suit you in the first place, as explained in the story before.        “it isn’t productivity that will be the greatest enemy but your satisfaction”.    satisfaction will determine how you perceive perfection and defines where your threshold for perfection lies. the real enemy is dissatisfaction. you get demotivated and restless. you lose sight and discontinue only because you are unable to pass your own expectation. so, it’s the only obstacle that comes in between productivity, from time to time.    productivity is far from being your enemy. the greatest enemy will be your expectations which lead to dissatisfaction. it will play a major role in crafting your idea of perfection in every day.",67,22,0.5056179718469891,0.15949820788530467,5.470588235294118,0.039346555719094733,2.203973916405285,21.95537809125486,558,2.388888888888889,2,6.127240143369176
28754.6,"brief     the financial crisis of 2008 started as a crisis in the subprime mortgage market (i.e. in a market where lending of loans is done to people who may have difficulty in maintaining the repayment schedule or in simple terms, loans were given out to people without proper checks and low credit scores) which ultimately led onto a huge global collapse.    the financial crisis of 2008 or great recession is considered the worst economic crisis since the great depression.    financial crisis explained –    in the year 1996, there was a dot-com boom (or otherwise known as the dot com bubble) in the united states, a period of massive growth in the use of the internet because of which the stock market prices started increasing rapidly. however, around the year 2000, it dropped which led people and investors to withdraw their investments from the stock market rapidly. it led to the decline of the price of shares in stock markets and the interest rate plummeted to around 1% very quickly in a short span.    investors were now looking for a brighter option than investing in stock markets.           fig – rise and fall of the dot com bubble    as interest rates went lower and lower, real estate prices started rising and the us govt also encouraged people to buy houses and properties. the demand for the same started rising rapidly and investors now found a great option to invest in (i.e. in real estate).    during that same time, investment banks saw an opportunity, chimed in and started buying loans from banks in bulk and clubbed multiple loans under a complex derivative called cdo (collateralized debt obligations) and started providing it to these investors after getting a credit rating of “aaa” (very safe investment) from the credit rating agencies. investors naturally fell for it and started buying these cdos.    so now, the risk factor of these loans got transferred from the banks to the investment banks and then again to the cdo investors.    with the high buying demand of cdos, investment banks started demanding or pressurizing banks to provide even more loans so that they can provide more cdos to the investors. however, banks had already provided loans to people with good credit history and regular income people. but in the hope of getting even more credit from investment banks, these same banks then started giving out subprime housing loans to people with low credit scores.approximately $174bn worth of loans were given out during the period 2000-2007 and most of them were clubbed as cdos with a “aaa” rating from the credit rating agencies. approximately 70% of these cdo’s were marked with a “aaa” rating.    investment banks and credit rating agencies were now enjoying large profits during this time. moody’s (a credit rating agency) profits increased 4x times during that period (2000-2007).    looking at the huge profits being made by the investment banks and credit rating agencies, insurance companies (like aig) now started giving out insurance on these cdos to the investors and they called it cds (credit default swap). aig believed that since the cdos were rated as “aaa” (very safe investment), the failure chances of these cdos were very minimal. they misjudged or were unaware of the fact that some of the loans that were clubbed under these cdos were sub prime loans.    now cdo investors started buying out cds from aig and other companies to safeguard and protect them from any losses. aig then started making huge profits because of the premiums that the investors had to pay. but they never realized the outcome if by any chance the cdos fail at some point in time. thus, the risk factor again got transferred from the cdo investors to the insurance companies.        fig – flow diagram showing how the risk factors got transferred    coming to the loan borrowers now, sub prime borrowers from banks were unaware of the fact of adjustable rate loans (interest rate of these loans keeps changing) and thus had to pay lower interests at the start but more interest rates later on.    the borrowers started defaulting on these loans when the interest rates increased dramatically around 2007 and thus banks had to then resell those houses to make up for the loans defaulted.  added to the problem was the fact that borrowers were not spending any amount of money from their pockets while taking loans and banks were providing the full amount of loans. almost 50% of the borrowers did not pay anything from their own pocket and bought the home only using the housing loan.    this led to a huge increase in the defaulters of borrowers and ultimately banks had to auction houses to gain credit back. with the high-interest rates and no one to buy the auctioned houses, this ultimately caused a chain reaction and banks were no longer receiving credit. the prices of real estate started falling drastically and people with good credit scores who had earlier taken housing loans also started defaulting because the price of their houses/homes fell below the loan amount that they had taken earlier. banks stopped receiving money and also because of this chain reaction, the value of cdos ultimately came down to 0.    some investors went for huge losses and few investment companies went bankrupt (ex – lehman brothers). moreover, insurance companies had to pay back those investors who had taken insurance. as a result, some of the insurance companies also went bankrupt. aig too almost lost about $100bn in paying back the investors who had earlier insured their cdos. however, the us govt. finally decided to bail out aig in order to save them from going bankrupt.    cdos and cdss were not regulated during that time by the federal reserve and thus this whole situation ultimately led to credit crunch (became very difficult to get loans) and the whole economy of the us underwent a crisis that led to a global impact all around the world. unemployment increased manifold and many new businesses had to shut down. global trades all around the world also saw a crisis and finally, global recession hit the world.    causes of the crisis –    improper screening of loan borrowers resulting in subprime loan borrowers which included even borrowers with no stable income.credit rating agencies rated all the cdos highly and investors were purchasing without proper monitoring. the

2893.8,"the human race is known to come up with inventions that decide its future. many scholars believe that artificial intelligence(ai) has been the most pioneering innovation since early humans discovered fire and invented the wheel. the advancement of groundbreaking technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning (ml) have constantly been shaping the future of humankind. the likes of mark zuckerberg have welcomed the evolution of ai. he once stated- “with a.i. especially, i am optimistic“. while according to elon musk, “ai can outsmart and endanger us.” however, we simply cannot ignore how useful and influential ai is in our daily lives.    the applications of ai and ml have delved deeply into various domains. the least to mention are healthcare, transportation, education, media, communication, manufacturing, and customer service. businesses worldwide are placing a significant emphasis on enhancing their customers’ overall experiences. as a result of ai, a massive leap in customer experience service has come up with the evolution of chatbots.    what is a chatbot, and how is it useful in business?    chatbots are ai-based systems used by businesses for communication with customers. customers can interact with chatbots directly via chat and voice applications. numerous online customer service platforms are utilizing chatbots to manage bulk phone calls, faqs, and other common customer service inquiries. chatbots resolve customer queries within no time and are accessible 24x7, enhancing the customer experience.    the use of technologies such as ai, ml, and nlp (natural language processing), enables the bot to analyze and identify the user’s problems and instantly give the most relevant answers to the queries.    platforms such as facebook messenger, wechat, discord, and slack have been extensively using chatbots for better communication.    advantages of using chatbots and their impact on customer support    there are numerous advantages of using chatbots in businesses- chatbots can communicate with multiple customers at once. they can be used to send regular updates about the products and exclusive offers by the company. they are available throughout the day, which is crucial for businesses that expand globally in different time zones. it becomes too cumbersome for businesses to have customer care support centers at various locations across the world. there is no human intervention involved. therefore, chatbots can be accessed worldwide anytime. chatbots reply instantly, and hence it increases customer engagement. chatbots can also be extensively used to collect user data and analyze it further to provide customized solutions. ml-based chatbot systems are learning from past conversations to generate more thoughtful replies.    roughly 40 % of internet users around the globe prefer interacting with chatbots rather than virtual agents. with leading sectors such as retail and healthcare rapidly turning towards digital technology, chatbots will continue to grow in popularity in the years to come.    chatbot market trends and forecast about its impact on customer support by 2040    according to some reports, it is anticipated that the size of the global chatbot market will expand at a compound annual growth rate (cagr) of approximately 26% from the years 2022 to 2030. in the year 2021, the chatbot market size was valued at a total of usd 525 million.    it is anticipated that the growing adoption of customer service activities among enterprises to reduce operating costs will be the primary factor driving the chatbot market.    in the past few years, some of the most significant advances that have been made in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been in the areas of perception and cognition. although there is much room for improvement in voice recognition technology, the tech giants like apple, amazon, and google have all made significant strides in this direction with their digital assistants siri, alexa, and google assistant, respectively.    deep learning systems are now actively utilized to decide trades accomplished on wall street and predict whether users will click on particular advertisements. it has increased efficiency on both the consumer and the business side of things. chatbots can help businesses save money by generating revenue, conducting research, generating leads, and increasing brand awareness. other uses for chatbots include research and lead generation.    given the trends of the data, we can expect the chatbot industry to surpass the billion-dollar mark in a few years. hence, by 2040 the chatbot industry would be having a multi-billion dollar market value.    how are companies utilizing chatbots to provide superior support for their customers- a comprehensive analysis that provides deep insights into the future of customer service in 2040.    bank of america is responsible for creating one of the most groundbreaking innovations. the recently introduced “erica” is intended to assist customers in making more informed choices regarding their finances. customers can make payments, check their balances, save money, and transfer funds with this chatbot, which uses artificial intelligence, algorithms, and predictive messaging. erica makes it possible for users to interact via text and voice, and it then uses the information provided to push insights to the customer.    klm royal dutch airlines is another company incorporating chatbots into their customer service channel. klm increased the number of customer interactions with the facebook messenger app by forty percent. the airline wanted to facilitate more effortless conversations between its employees and passengers without compromising passengers’ right to personal privacy. klm was aware that its customers spent a significant amount of time using facebook and messenger, so the company decided to implement a chatbot as its platform for customer service. messenger is now the channel through which customers can directly receive booking details, boarding passes, and flight status updates. on a typical day, klm receives an average of five messages per minute through facebook messenger. during peak traffic, that number jumps to over eleven messages per minute.    these innovations with chatbots will surely pave the way for the future. by 2040, chatbots will completely revolutionize the customer experience domain.    challenges ahead    there are apparent constraints with ai technology. the absence of emotional intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when ai-driven chatbots are used with customers, even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers.    the availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. this restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. maintaining the security of the customer’s data is also a key challenge.    conclusion    even though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function, there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. the chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi-folds by 2040. the optimistic thing about this technology is that ml-based systems can learn from their own experiences and improve with time. hence there is a high chance that chatbot technology is perhaps “the next big thing” in the customer service domain.",55,12,0.6417910351971488,0.09824046920821114,6.686274509803922,0.08889407032832515,2.710067432052899,60.625755963917754,682,2.8269794721407626,1,7.174486803519062
29216.4,"gender diversity is an equal representation of all genders in workplaces. one of the most important sectors where there is under-representation of gender diversity is the technological industry. gender diversity means you have an equal opportunity which is not limited by gender. but, the true reality is gender diversity is a far outcry in the world.
 
 
 
 gender diversity isn’t a new topic but an old and global phenomenon and technology industry is not a stranger to it.  women are often underrepresented in the technology sector. to understand the gap, let’s look at some statistics.
 
 
 
 
 the percentage of women employed across all job sectors in the us has grown to be 47%.
 out of 47%. 34% belong to the top 5 technology companies (amazon, apple, facebook, google, and microsoft).
 women software engineer hires have only increased 2% over the last 20 years
 50% of women said they have experienced gender discrimination at work.
 only 37% of tech startups have at least one woman on the board of directors.
 the ratio of men to women in engineering is 5:1.
 25.5% of google’s leaders on a global scale are women.
  even in the tech conference organizations, there were fewer female keynote speakers than male speakers.
 eight percent to 17 percent of gay and transgender workers report being passed over for a job or fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
 globally, women only earn 77 cents to the dollar when compared to men.
 according to a mckinsey global institute report, if women were to play an identical role in labor markets to that of men, as much as $28 trillion, or 26%, could be added to the global annual gdp by 2025.
 according to unesco, over 2.7 billion women are legally restricted from having the same choice of jobs as men. and women’s labor force participation rate is 48.5 % compared to a rate of 75% for men.
 
 
 
 
 after looking at these staggering numbers, we see how biased gender diversity is even in the technological sector.
 
 
 
 need of the hour
 
 
 
 with rapid industrialization and education about the importance of rights, gender diversity is very important in today’s world. gender equality represents a society that has lesser violence and provides a safer world for everyone. it is also directly proportional to sustainable development and ensures human rights to everyone. as today’s markets are increasing along with customers’ preferences, to understand customer profiles and build products we need gender diversity in our organizations. equal representation helps in a better decision-making process for a positive impact.
 
 
 
 men and women invest back into their families and having gender equality and diversity helps build values into families and households. empowering individuals not only help themselves but also the economy of the nations. gender equality and diversity should be built into organizations’ beliefs and values.

 global gender gap report (2017)
 
 
 
 why is this happening?
 
 
 
 perception: if we see the word “gender”, it is a socially constructed definition. and this definition changes as per different cultural norms. in a much broader term, our society is also not aware of the concept of binary and non-binary gender, which includes queer, trans, and intersex individuals as well. the socially acceptable thing is to have gender expressions as per our gender identity. so, when it comes to choosing their career, people tend to choose a job role that gives them higher social belongingness. e.g. we see more women(as compared to men) in nursing careers as it requires more feminine qualities.
 
 
 
 there are different versions of this perception: which we can see either in the society(in terms of socially assigned gender roles) or in the workplace(in the form of gender discrimination, stereotypical thinking, sexism, etc.). e.g. as per their assigned roles in society, women are most likely to take care of their family and children, and this affects their income and career growth. the motherhood penalty is a term defined by sociologists which states about the inverse correlation between income level and the number of children, i.e. there is also an income difference between a mother and a non-mother employee. as per oecd data(2012), there is a 7% reduction in wages for women per child.
 
 
 
 lack of economic opportunities: even in the tech industry, women are paid less than men. as per ilo data(2019), on average women are paid 20% less than men worldwide.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 even when it comes to promotion, men are preferred more. it is to be noted that the numbers are even worse when there is intersectionality involved. e.g., a transgender woman will be paid less than a white woman and so on. as per the national centre for transgender equality, one out of two transgender people faces adverse effects: including 23% were denied a promotion, 44% were passed over for a particular job position and 26% are fired from their workplace just because they are transgender.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ways to improve gender diversity:
 
 
 
 we can improve this scenario from the perspective of different stakeholders who are involved.
 
 
 
 for society :
 
 
 
 creating tech awareness from school level: as per the hdr report( 2017), no. of boys pursuing stem program is 97% higher than girls. one way to improve this is to introduce more strong role models to advocate for this issue. minority gender communities should be aware of the multiple job opportunities and career growth available in this field. these job roles are not even gender-specific anymore. for developing countries like india, stem scholarship programs can be introduced from the secondary education level.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 address bias/stereotypes: it is to be noted that perceptions, stereotypes, and biases are not just something we learn in school but our upbringing also creates these, the things we watch, listen, and read daily. so, it also becomes the duty of the society to create a more inclusive environment. e.g. a more privileged person should fight for the fundamental right of the less empowered or less privileged person in society.
 
 
 
 there should be active encouragement from parents, teachers, and educators for students in stem programs regardless of their gender identity.
 
 
 
 for companies:
 
 
 
 to promote gender diversity in the workplace, companies need to focus on three things:
 
 
 
 unbiased recruitment policies:
 
 
 
 generally, there is a lot of unconscious bias and prejudices when hiring women, trans, intersex, and queer individuals. there needs to be a diversity and inclusivity team in the hr itself that addresses these issues. a blind recruitment drive can be conducted where there is no need to mention gender in any of the documents.
 
 
 
 having structured questions during the interview might help to remove any unconscious biases.
 
 
 
 diversity sensitivity training: workplace policies need to create a company image that hires everyone irrespective of their gender identity and can even keep it optional in all the job formalities and documents.
 
 
 
 conducting proper sensitivity training to employees is essential as they need to use correct pronoun/gender-neutral language.
 
 
 
 not just sensitivity training, strong workplace policies need to be in place which deal with any form of harassment or gender discrimination.
 
 
 
  to create accountability and transparency in their process, companies can also share diversity and inclusivity company data.
 
 
 
 retention policies:
 
 
 
 creating mentorship models:
 
 
 
 
 have a mentorship program in the workplace that advocates for women, trans, intersex, and non-binary individuals as leaders and encourages role models within this community.
 
 
 
 
 
 need to promote diversity in the workplace via proper workplace policies and legal guidelines(e.g. conducting mandatory sensitization training for all employees or framing zero-tolerance policies.)
 
 
 
 
 including proper maternity leaves, child care facilities, and flexibility of working hours/remote working arrangements can be helpful for minority gender in keeping their work-life balance.
 
 
 
 develop support programs for these communities who are joining after maternity leave. it might be in terms of psychiatric or mentorship support.
 
 
 
 increase pay parities: it can be done in the following ways:
 
 
 
 
 create flexibility in job roles so that women can move on to higher positions.
 build an inclusive workplace that supports pay parity— no salary difference based on gender for the same job roles.
 create a transparent performance review process and ensure that there are no unconscious biases during the recruitment process.
 doing a pay review within the organization to check how much pay difference exists before making framing policies.
 
 
 
 
 lastly, there needs to be proper government policies in place which provide a constitutional or legal framework starting from the basic education level. it may begin from increasing the gross enrollment rates of all students in schools (irrespective of their gender identity) for developing countries( like india) to have proper compensation policies in the workplace(as similar to what states like california, new york has adopted) to ensure pay parity.",39,27,0.18181817906336092,0.08098159509202454,7.990196078431373,0.10783870826714854,3.239213914679409,87.88854723772606,815,2.7300613496932513,1,6.792638036809816
29678.2,"the covid-19 crisis and its fallout including recession, layoffs, and uneven economic pain-as well as recent protests over police brutality and demands for racial justice, have presented many of us with challenges that we’ve not encountered before. the high-stakes and unfamiliar nature of these situations have left many people feeling fearful of missteps. no one can reduce mistakes to zero, but you can learn to harness your drive to prevent them and channel it into better decision making. use these tips to become a more effective worrier.    don’t be afraid or ashamed of your fear.     our culture glorifies fearlessness. the traditional image of a leader is one who is smart, tough, and unafraid. but fear, like any emotion, has an evolutionary purpose and upside. your concern about making mistakes is there to remind you that we’re in a challenging situation. a cautious leader has value. this is especially true in times like these. so don’t get caught up in ruminating: “i shouldn’t be so fearful.”    don’t be ashamed or afraid of your fear of making mistakes and don’t interpret it as evidence that you’re an indecisive leader, or not bold, not visionary. if you have a natural tendency to be prevention-focused, channel it to be bold and visionary! (if you struggle to believe this, identify leaders who have done just that by figuring out how to prevent disasters.)    use emotional agility skills.                       fear of mistakes can paralyze people. emotional agility skills are an antidote to this paralysis. this process starts with labeling your thoughts and feelings, such as “i feel anxious i’m not going to be able to control my customers enough to keep my staff safe.” stating your fears out loud helps diffuse them. it’s like turning the light on in a dark room. next comes accepting reality. for example, “i understand that people will not always behave in ideal ways.” list off every truth you need to accept. then comes acting your values. let’s say one of your highest values is conscientiousness. how might that value apply in this situation? for example, it might involve making sure your employees all have masks that fit them well or feel comfortable airing any grievances they have. identify your five most important values related to decision-making in a crisis. then ask yourself how each of those is relevant to the important choices you face.    repeat this process for each of your fears. it will help you tolerate the fact that we sometimes need to act when the course of action isn’t clear and avoid the common anxiety trap whereby people try to reduce uncertainty to zero.    focus on your processes.     worrying can help you make better decisions if you do it effectively. most people don’t . when you worry, it should be solutions-focused, not just perseverating on the presence of a threat. direct your worry towards behaviors that will realistically reduce the chances of failure.    we can control systems, not outcomes. what are your systems and processes for avoiding making mistakes? direct your worries into answering questions like these: is the data you’re relying on reliable? what are the limitations of it? how do your systems help prevent groupthink? what procedures do you have in place to help you see your blind spots? how do you ensure that you hear valuable perspectives from underrepresented stakeholders? what are your processes for being alerted to a problem quickly and rectifying it if a decision has unexpected consequences?    broaden your thinking.     when we’re scared of making a mistake, our thinking can narrow around that particular scenario. imagine you’re out walking at night. you’re worried about tripping, so you keep looking down at your feet. next thing you know you’ve walked into a lamp post. or, imagine the person who is scared of flying. they drive everywhere, even though driving is objectively more dangerous. when you open the aperture, it can help you see your greatest fears in the broader context of all the other threats out there. this can help you get a better perspective on what you fear the most.    it might seem illogical that you could reduce your fear of making a mistake by thinking about other negative outcomes. but this strategy can help kick you into problem-solving mode and lessen the mental grip a particular fear has on you. a leader might be so highly focused on minimizing or optimizing for one particular thing, they don’t realize that other people care most about something else. find out what other people’s priorities are.    recognize the value of leisure.    fear grabs us. it makes it difficult to direct our attention away. this is how it is designed to work, so that we don’t ignore threats. some people react to fear with extreme hypervigilance. they want to be on guard, at their command post, at all times. this might manifest as behavior like staying up all night to work.    that type of adrenalin-fueled behavior can have short-term value, but it can also be myopic. a different approach can be more useful for bigger picture thinking. we need leisure (and sleep!) to step back, integrate the threads of our thinking, see blindspots, and think creatively. get some silent time. although much maligned, a game of golf might be exactly what you need to think about tough problems holistically.    detach from judgment-clouding noise.     as mentioned, when people are fearful they can go into always-on monitoring mode. you may have the urge to constantly look at what everyone else is doing, to always be on social media, or check data too frequently. this can result in information overload. your mind can become so overwhelmed that you start to feel cloudy or shut down. recognize if you’re doing this and limit over-monitoring or overchecking. avoid panicked, frenzied behavior.    on its own, being afraid of making mistakes doesn’t make you more or less likely to make good decisions. if you worry excessively in a way that focuses only on how bad the experience of stress and uncertainty feels, you might make do or say the wrong things. however, if you understand how anxiety works at a cognitive level, you can use it to motivate careful but bold and well-reasoned choices.",38,83,-0.37190082337272046,0.22916666666666666,5.176470588235294,0.033517436353302926,2.083995209835439,17.697206394543944,528,2.609848484848485,2,6.426136363636363
30140.0,"the word pandemic may be the most used word for the last decade, and we know why. the year 2020 comes with a lot of unprecedented threats to humans as well as to nature. while no business was left insulated from its effect, small businesses were one of the most affected, as they rely on day to day sales and keep the inventory minimum, based on the demand of customers and have a low margin to maneuver.    in an article by hsbc’s navigator, which described the preparedness and contingency plan for the future, indian business rated high among its peers. the businesses in india have shown resilience to face adversity which can be attributed to varying degrees of adjustment and adaptability. the businesses, while able to adhere to government guidelines have managed to facilitate their customers efficiently and effectively. however, the impact on micro, small, and medium enterprises cannot be left unattended.     the indian subcontinent has an estimated ₹ 633.88 lakh of msme, out of which 51.2% are in rural areas which employ 44.84% of the total employment provided by this sector. the msme sector with 1170 lakh people constitutes 40% of the total workforce. as per the ministry of commerce msme contribution in gross domestic product (gdp) and export are 37% and 43% respectively.    with the huge contribution toward gdp as well as export, the impact on the national economy due to the shock in the msme sector from the pandemic will be equally devastating. while different businesses face different types of obstacles, we have pointed out 8 of the most common issues faced by them.    low working capital -: small businesses usually have a low working capital ratio which means that they don’t have enough capital to finance their daily requirements. in these difficult times, this problem has gone to the next level as they will have obligations to pay but due to less or no revenue for a few months, there are high chances that they may not be able to meet them.low cash cycle -: according to a survey done by economic times, they have found that small businesses usually run on a 27 days cash cycle and due to pandemic looming around they are not able to operate efficiently. more than half of the small businesses of the country have either exhausted their funds or are close to doing so. it is because of the unprecedented demand crash due to lockdown.     not registered -: many of the small businesses in india are not registered as they are just too small and this invisibility is both an advantage and disadvantage for them. being out of the formal system, they don’t have to maintain proper books of accounts, pay the taxes and follow all the regulatory norms but the downside of this is that it is difficult for them to access government programs focused on them and make use of it.difficult to get financial support -: it becomes a huge task for small businesses when it comes to getting loans. this is because they don’t have proper accounts and assets which they can keep as mortgage to get loans from banks. due to this, they have to use a traditional method of lending which involves a high rate of interest and during these times it is also getting difficult to get loans from this area.    existential crisis: – with the abrupt change in the business environment the businesses either have low production or they cease to exist. while low production will put a burden on the owner’s pocket but if they closed their business and start fresh, the cost of starting a new business post-crisis will be high and with limited creditworthiness which makes business difficult to regain their lost market share. migration -: in the starting days of lockdown small businesses were not able to pay their workers which led to migration, as they moved back to their hometowns. this has led to a problem of the availability of a suitable workforce for these businesses as they are trying to get things back to normal. absence of skills required -: as, hiring of new workers is done to get things to normal it is getting difficult for them to provide them with suitable skills needed for some particular jobs and also the existing workforce is not trained enough to cope with the new normal of working online.creditworthiness: – it is defined as the extent to which a company considered suitable to receive financial credit, often based on the reliability in the paying money in the past. as businesses are dependent upon the line of credit and the supply chain if it gets hampered it will result in the loss of revenue as well as reputation.    for any business, cash in hand is oxygen. the small business which usually has at most 1-month cash to run the business if the revenue stream dries up, which in this tough time has to improve gradually. to manage the optimal cash balance is the key to success in this tough time. the optimal cash balance here, defined as “the less of the amount of cash outflow in form rent, employee salaries, and raw material without postponing the payable as they are doing what banks have to do, to the inflow from sale”.     cash conversion cycle -: it refers to how fast cash moves through the business. in these times, when a lot of businesses are switching to online platforms they should think of improving the cash cycle maybe by making changes in the sales cycle, reducing inventory in hand, and improving upon debtor’s turnover ratio and cash collection period.prioritize the products – the owner of the business should do an analysis of all the products and services it offers and ranks them on the basis of profitability. they should focus more on the most profitable product and remove the least profitable product from their portfolio.labour productivity – while it is difficult to manage the business with the current scenario, if any business manages to do so, they can have a huge advantage over others. the productivity of the employee defined as the unit output produced by per employee. while firing underperforming employees, reduce the salary expense but variable performance-based compensation will strive them to increase productivity.getting new skills – there are many online platforms available from which existing employees can be provided with new skills at a very lower cost. this can also give them an advantage in the future if the investment is strategically done.tapping the resources provided by the government and other financial institutions -: the government of india has launched a rescue plan for small businesses through which they can get loans in a much easier way compared to before. it increased the upper limit of the outstanding loan amount from ₹. 25 crores to ₹ 50 crores. some financial institutions also launched schemes like covid-19 start-up assistance scheme (‘csas’) by sidbi, rbi enhancing the limit for loans to 90% from 75%, etc.making a 3-month financial plan – small business owners should make a different financial plan for the next 3 months and focus on the areas where cost can be cut like delaying payments of rent if possible. it should majorly focus on what costs are necessary and which cost can be put on hold for some time.tapping the newly available opportunities -: it is a very good opportunity to capitalize on the available resources and encash the different opportunities which have arisen due to this scenario like demand for sanitizers, masks, more online platforms for essentials, etc.    in any given situation, business is like juggling between multiple tasks to optimize the performance while maximizing the revenue. the current situation has added another layer of challenge. this challenge will test management skills in various aspects of our business owner.     with this article, we have pointed out the major challenges and possible ways to alleviate the impact. as anthony robbins quotes, “every problem is a gift—without problems we would not grow”, the current market has wiped out their share in the market which gives an opportunity to other businesses to grow and lower the expense.    while there may be many facets that need to be handled precisely, communication is one of the major tools that will create a positive environment among workers or teams which will influence the customer behavior and result in terms of revenue. the communication will also help to increase productivity and create trust in a supply chain which will improve the cash conversion cycles and working capital ratio.    marketing through word of mouth has no added cost but the benefit can be scaled too much-required revenue. the choice of an effective marketing tool can also influence our target customer and will influence their will to buy the product or service(s) strategically.    cash from operating activity improves if we were able to lower our expenses. to lower these expenses, small business owners have to create a different plan (good, average, and worst) keeping the 6-month frame in mind. breaking down them in monthly targets would further help them to identify the actual scenario and update the strategy accordingly.      as warren buffet quotes, “you only have to do a

30601.8,"some vendors (fruit and vegetable sellers) began venturing out after a few days without explicit permission and immediately faced police harassment. after a few weeks, the government eased restrictions and essential vendors were being permitted to vend (due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks). however, the cost of doing business, as well as the risk, has gone up significantly, with vendors not having access to wholesale markets and suppliers and having to spend more on travel costs due to travel restrictions in place in the city. also, with the lockdown still partially in place, the number of buyers has gone down and so have earnings. due to the harsh summer heat, perishable fruits and vegetables also have a reduced shelf life so vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have.   the state has recently announced a stimulus package of inr 5000 crore for nearly 50 lakh vendors, acknowledging the grave impact of their loss of livelihood. the intended relief for vendors will be a credit loan that will provide an initial working capital of inr 10,000 for all vendors, but this is not sufficient. instead of credit, the government should think of converting it into direct income benefit, a cash grant, as livelihood support to start the income activity regularly. the vendors need income support to be able to restart work, and if they are not able to do so, how will they return the loan. in the face of the ever-changing crisis, vendor organizations have to step forward and advocate for vendors to be provided the resources they need to be able to resume their livelihoods. to this end, vendors organizations could consider the following for an advocacy agenda:   livelihood promotion for all vendors, including those selling non-essential goods: the impact of covid-19 has been very harsh on informal workers who have exhausted their capital and earnings in trying to feed themselves during the extended lockdown period. vendors need to be able to resume vending for survival and the government should take steps to begin to reopen markets and allow vendors back on the streets.reopening of markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene: delhi has many different types of traditionally crowded markets including weekly markets (for fresh food, cooked food and essential household items) and daily markets that operate on the sides of roads. these markets will need to resume keeping in mind the need for social distancing and the government should release guidelines for the same. going forward, vending zones must also be designed keeping in mind the need for social distancing and for sufficient hygiene facilities (running water, washing stations and toilets). the authorities should work with town vending committees (tvcs) for the same.provide direct support which is de-linked from existing registration requirements: as lockdown is lifted and vending resumes, vendors who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to resume their work. the government stimulus package, while a welcome step, is insufficient in the nature of relief (credit not direct cash transfer) and eligibility (only registered vendors are eligible, which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country). in addition, government relief and support needs to be de-linked from very rigid registration requirements, as very few vendors have been registered in india. in delhi, out of roughly 300,000 street vendors, only about 131,00 have some form of occupational identification. if the criteria for any kind of cash grant or livelihood support is linked to occupational identification by the state, then the government should also accept registration with a workers’ organisation/union as a proxy for government-issued vending passes.ensuring hygiene and social distancing at sites of vending: the government needs to take steps for provision of running water and soap/sanitisers for street vendors at their place of work. additionally, vendor organisations should work with food safety authorities in the country to train vendors (especially cooked food vendors) in ways to maintain hygiene while working.taking steps to survey and register more vendors for access to government benefits: as mentioned earlier, the number of vendors who have some form of identification are a fraction of the actual population of vendors in delhi. before the crisis and subsequent lockdown, the town vending committees (tvcs) were supposed to start surveying and registering vendors. as we get used to the new normal, the process of survey and registration should also begin to ensure that all vendors are able to access social security benefits and financial aid during this period of crisis.",25,13,0.31578946537396146,0.0892018779342723,4.176470588235294,0.042261115401990644,1.6874926814549143,18.003235161248014,426,2.643192488262911,0,6.802816901408451
31063.6,"the covid-19 pandemic has grown into one of the most major and socially disruptive health crises in recent memory, with growing worried about how the pandemic’s catastrophic economic and social repercussions are affecting food systems at both the global and local levels. given the importance of the retail food environment in establishing and sustaining healthy diets, interruptions to specific aspects of it, such as the availability of fresh vegetables, could have a negative influence on population health, which has already been noted as a source of worry.   despite the dominance of national and international supermarket chains, warehouse clubs, and supercenters in grocery retail, vegetables are offered in a number of other food retail settings. fresh vegetable #vendors are typically smaller and more community-oriented than other restaurant or retail food outlets and can include chain or independent grocery stores, greengrocers, storefront stands, street carts, and even makeshift platforms dedicated to the sale of fresh vegetables. smaller community fresh vegetable vendors who may conduct business on the sides of major streets or on storefronts have played an integral role in the food environment in large urban centers such as new york city (nyc), particularly in ethnic enclaves, despite the fact that fresh produce does not have a significantly higher nutritional value and fresh produce can also be purchased at these larger food retailers.   since the covid-19 pandemic began, many fresh fruit and vegetable vendors, notably street carts selling fresh vegetables in cities across the united states, including new york city, have been forced to close owing to a combination of falling demand and fear of catching covid-19. the importance of fresh vegetable vendors varies by neighborhood within cities. furthermore, these fresh vegetable vendors attract visitors and interborough shoppers from a variety of cultural backgrounds not only asian ones who are looking for things that are not available elsewhere in the city or for the same low prices.   these fresh vegetable vendors, unlike larger, well-established grocery store vendors, may not have the financial infrastructure to sustain the shifts in supply and demand produced by the covid-19 epidemic; consequently, the danger of closure or modifications in services may be greater for these vendors.   in order to assess the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on services offered by fresh vegetable vendors, surveillance #data from both before and after the pandemic’s inception is required.   after a few days, vegetable dealers began venturing out without explicit permission and were quickly harassed by police. after a few weeks, the government relaxed the limitations, allowing vital traders to sell their wares (due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks). however, the cost of doing business has increased dramatically, as vendors no longer have access to wholesale markets and suppliers, and they must spend more on travel expenditures owing to city-imposed travel limitations. furthermore, with the partial lockdown still in place, the number of buyers has decreased, as have earnings. perishable vegetables have a shorter shelf life in the summer heat, thus vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have.   consider the situation of delhi at the starting of covid 19. the state has launched an inr 5000 crore stimulus package for over 50 lakh vendors, realizing the serious consequences of their loss of livelihood. the targeted relief for vendors is a credit facility that will provide all sellers with an initial working capital of inr 10,000, but this will not be enough. instead of credit, the government should consider changing it into a direct income benefit, such as a cash grant, to help people start earning money on a regular basis. the vendors require income support in order to resume work, and how will they repay the loan if they are unable to do so? vendor organizations must step forth in the face of the ever-changing crises and lobby for vendors to be given the resources they need to continue their livelihoods. vendor organizations could use the following as part of their advocacy agenda:   promotion of vendors’ livelihoods, particularly those selling non-essential goods: covid-19 has had a particularly painful impact on informal labourers, who have spent all of their savings and wages trying to feed themselves during the prolonged lockdown. vendors must be permitted to restart peddling in order to survive, and the government should take steps to reopen marketplaces and reintroduce vendors to the streets.market reopening with social distance and hygiene in mind: delhi features a variety of typically crowded markets, including weekly markets (for fresh food, cooked meals, and necessary household items) and daily markets on the sides of highways. these markets will need to resume considering the necessity for social separation, and the government should issue recommendations in this regard. in the future, vending zones must be planned with social distancing in mind, as well as adequate sanitary facilities (running water, washing stations and toilets). for this, the government should collaborate with town vending committees (tvcs).provide direct assistance that is not tied to existing registration requirements: when the lockdown is lifted and vending starts, vendors who have been at home for months will require direct income benefits in order to return to work. while the government stimulus plan is a positive step, it falls short in terms of assistance (credit rather than direct cash transfer) and eligibility (only registered vendors are eligible, which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country). furthermore, government assistance and support must be divorced from the country’s strict registration requirements, as only a few vendors have been registered in india. only about 131,00 of delhi’s 300,000 street sellers have any type of employment identity. if the state requires occupational identity for any type of monetary grant or livelihood assistance, the government should accept registration with a workers’ organization/union as a surrogate for government-issued vending passes.providing flowing water and soap/sanitizers to street sellers at their place of business: the government should take steps to provide street vendors with running water and soap/sanitizers at their place of business. additionally, vendor organizations should collaborate with local food safety authorities to instruct vendors (particularly those selling prepared foods) on how to maintain hygiene while on the job.taking measures to conduct a survey and register additional vendors for government assistance: as previously stated, the number of sellers with some sort of identity is a small percentage of the total number of vendors in delhi. the town vending committees (tvcs) were expected to begin surveying and registering vendors before the crisis and ensuing lockout. as we adjust to the new normal, the survey and registration procedure should begin to guarantee that all vendors have access to social security benefits and financial assistance during this difficult time.   finally, some fresh vegetable sellers may have shuttered for a period of time early in the epidemic, only to reopen recently. alternatively, vendors may have launched soon after the in-person checks were completed, but still within the june-july 2020 endpoint timeframe. this is a drawback of the method; in order to offer the most reliable covid-19 pandemic monitoring data, data must be collected in a short period of time.",40,25,0.23076922721893497,0.09339080459770115,6.823529411764706,0.08889407032832515,2.7649693928372123,61.870272948514305,696,2.7169540229885056,0,7.005747126436781
31525.4,"as the coronavirus pandemic unfolds, most industries face problems they had never imagined or prepared for. the aviation and tourism industries face the highest stress as coronavirus spreads because not only are they a (usually) a leisure spending but also the nature of the disease directly conflicts with the industries’ innate business models. in this article, we will look at the impact of covid-19 pandemic on the tourism and aviation industries both from the demand side and the supply side.    the aviation and tourism industries has two major customers: tourists and business travellers. let us base this essay in the india and see what the reaction of the customer segments is expected to be like.    almost all tourists will avoid vacationing for the foreseeable future because of:    financial hardship: an exceptionally large part of the world’s working population has been affected financially because of the pandemic. unemployment rates are soaring and the ones who do still have a job are facing pay-cuts, furloughs and deferment of salaries.risk of contraction: because the disease spreads via social contact, it will only be safe to vacation if the destination is regularly sanitized and is not crowded. inherently, tourist destinations are not compliant with these regulations and even if the industry makes a change to being clean and introducing social distancing measures, convincing risk averse tourists of to travel to these vacation spots will be difficult.expansion of alternatives ways to relax: as most people adapt to work-from-home environments, the burnout rate is declining. people are more relaxed in their own homes and very few people are eagerly looking for a getaway. combined with this deterrent is the rise of alternative ways to relax. more and more people are going out for walks, doing yoga and finding new hobbies. due to this increase for pursuit for happiness at home, it might be likely that tourists will avoid traveling because they don’t feel the urge to break-free and move away for a holiday.    now, let us look at different types of holiday revellers. tourists can be foreigners or domestic tourists. according to business insider “in 2019, almost 10 million foreign tourists visited india — spending over ₹1,800 billion during january to november period.”. however, because of the pandemic, almost all this business has been lost.    due to the reasons stated above most foreigners will not prefer to travel. those who do dare to venture out, perhaps wooed by discounted deals to places which would have otherwise been out of their budgets, will possibly be warded off by the one of the following factors:    poor quality of health care in india: in the off chance that a tourist contracts covid-19, they will probably be accustomed to a better healthcare system than the one india provides. being a developing country india will find it hard to convince foreign tourists that our healthcare systems are up to the mark of their home countries.densely populated regions around tourist destinations: because most tourist destinations support a neighbouring economy, the areas are often densely populated, which leads to a higher risk of transmission of covid-19 and the foreign tourists are cognizant of this fact.    moving our focus to domestic tourists, we subdivide our population according to income levels:    below poverty line: these people don’t travellower income families: these people majorly only travel to religious places or to visit family. thus, they don’t contribute to the aviation industry at all and generate very little revenue for the tourism industry as they prefer to stay in cheap lodges or at a relative’s place.middle income families: they travel once in a year or two and tend to avoid airplanes. revenue in the tourism industry is also limited from this subsection.upper middle income families: they vacation regularly, often flying to near-by holiday spots. this section of our economy is severely hit by the coronavirus’ financial hardships. people have lost jobs and almost everyone has low liquidity. being risk averse, these people will probably save money and avoid spending on vacations for some time. the loss of volumes from this sector will affect the aviation and tourism industries severely.high income families: this sector is relatively insulated from the financial hardships caused by coronavirus and is likely to spend on holidays if they are assured of the sanitization and social distancing.    in order to attract well paying customers, the aviation and tourism industries will have to spend a considerable amount of money to become sanitation compliant which will push profit margins even lower. most aviation and tourism activities made money not on individual margins but on collective volumes, thus, they are inherently incompatible with the concept of social distancing.    because of covid-19 pandemic, businesses have realized that more and more meetings can be handled over video calls, thus, the movement of business personnel will be restricted. there will still be some representatives who will fly out to conduct business, but the industry can expect a permanent drop in revenue from this sector.    moving over to the supply side, the aviation and tourism industries face strong disruptions in their supply chain. because the industry is a leisure expense, manufacturing of many supporting equipment like the adventure sports gears and even parts of planes themselves has stopped. because of the drop in demand, it is going to be tough to get the supply chain back up again. furthermore, workers are afraid to show up to their jobs because of the high risk of contracting the virus due to exposure to multiple customers from different geographies.    let us now see some examples of how the industry has done through march and april.    airbnbs (in america):     the bookings vanished in mid-march. property owners had bought or leased real estate to list on the app were severely affected. the sharing economy, like uber, lyft and doordash had taken a hit but airbnb was worse off because their expenses include cleaning services, interior design (one-time spend), and property maintenance which are fixed costs.    thus, because of the pandemic the revenue was gone but the costs exist. they have people who depend on the owner’s rental income which made the problem worse.    hosts usually decide cancellation policy, but under extreme circumstances, like this one, the company decided to override all existing policies (many of whom weren’t strict) and gave full refund to the guests. the company got $2 billion loan and has helped out the owners, financially by paying 25% for cancelled bookings capping at 5k/host. they have helped some hosts by getting them eligible for small business loans and avoid eviction.    thankfully, there are too few properties to cause a housing crisis, but breakdown could cause strain on lenders and undermine property values (all want to sell to avoid foreclosure or defaulting on loans). airdna states that the listing split-up for airbnb is: 33% list single property, 33% owners list 2-24 properties, 33% hosts have 25+ properties.    some state governments in america have banned short-term rentals. this hurt the airbnb owners because people looking to quarantine outside their homes or near relatives could’ve generated revenues.    so, what are hosts doing now?    many are discounting units and looking for long-term tenants (12 months). many are planning to apply for a small-business loan, seek forbearance from banks, find long-term tenants independently of airbnb and sell property.    reluctance of workers to comeback to work (america):    according to the wall street journal, roughly half of all us workers stand to earn more from the coronavirus rather than their work pay cheques. however, it must be noted that some have not gotten their money due to bureaucratical issues.    this complicates reopening because workers don’t want to come back and expose themselves to the virus and earn less. but businesses want workers to come back so that their small business loans can be forgiven, and business can reopen. however, money in the consumer’s pockets means the economy expected to rebound quickly when businesses open. about 40 million americans are now on unemployment benefits, majorly from restaurant, hospitality, and retail industries.    congress chose a flat amount of relief because it was really time-consuming for payments to be calibrated to each worker’s lost wages. their $600 federal payment corresponds to $15/hours wage, but 21 states follow $7.25/hours.    most workers don’t want to sit at home and are anxious to get back to work, but right now staying at home is the smartest financial decision for their families.    workers should be ineligible for unemployment benefits if a job is made available to them. but owners are reluctant to report workers to authorities and sever relationships with employees they may need more later in the year when tourism demand is expected to pick up. without income support, low-wage workers would likely seek out other jobs, including side hustles and gig work, which could expose them and their households to the virus. thus, according to the government, it was important to give such a large stimulus to the economy.    coronavirus on planes:    studies of sars suggested that people sitting close to infectious persons were at large risk. combined with that, in long journeys, passengers may take off masks. thus, the risks of transmission are large and airlines need to focus on figuring out how to prevent transmission in planes.    currently, the airlines plan on using self-cleaning material, long-lasting disinfectant, touchless lavatories, uv light as a disinfectant, antimicrobial coating for frequently touched surfaces, and cleaning between flights.    however, even after these efforts, only 12% of people are flying (compared to last year, same time) as of 27th may 2020.    aviation and tourism industries have the curse of being a luxury expense and thus, as the coronavirus pandemic spread, the entire industry jolted to a halt. they are one of the hardest-hit sectors and have to adapt to a new normal wherein the revenue levels are unlikely to match to pre-covid levels and margins have also reduced. however, in with a bleak future, this industry is here to stay because people have to travel, and eventually they will vacation as well. coronavirus has become a “survival of the fittest” test for this industry and the stakeholders will come out of this disaster with strong business processes.",43,55,-0.12244897834235736,0.10304942166140904,9.323529411764707,0.08452223080398129,3.7632206570274755,80.3806414945862,951,2.6498422712933754,4,6.615141955835962

321.0,"the rise of e-health, or the use of electronic means to facilitate health care, has been a major development in the healthcare industry in recent years. the use of technology to improve access to healthcare and make it more efficient has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about healthcare and its delivery. by 2030, it is likely that e-health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare, and this essay will explore the potential impacts of e-health on humans by that year.    one of the main benefits of e-health is the increased access it provides to healthcare services. with the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies, patients can receive care from anywhere with an internet connection. this can be particularly beneficial for those who live in rural or underserved areas, where access to healthcare providers may be limited. it can also be useful for those with mobility issues or disabilities that make it difficult for them to visit a healthcare facility in person. by 2030, it is likely that the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies will become even more widespread, potentially leading to a decrease in healthcare disparities and an increase in access to care for those who may have previously had difficulty accessing it.    in addition to increasing access to care, e-health has the potential to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. by using electronic medical records and other digital technologies, healthcare providers can more easily share and access patient information, streamlining the process of providing care. this can lead to more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans, and potentially reduce the need for unnecessary or redundant tests and procedures. by 2030, it is likely that the use of electronic medical records and other digital technologies will become even more widespread, potentially leading to a more efficient and effective healthcare system.    another potential impact of e-health by 2030 is the ability to use data analytics to improve population health. by collecting and analyzing data on patient health and healthcare utilization, healthcare providers can identify trends and patterns that may help them better understand and address the health needs of their patient populations. this could lead to the development of targeted interventions and prevention strategies that are more effective at improving population health. additionally, the use of wearable technology and other digital health devices can help individuals track and manage their own health, potentially leading to improved health outcomes for individuals and populations.    while the potential benefits of e-health are significant, there are also potential challenges and drawbacks to consider. one concern is the potential for cybersecurity breaches, which could compromise the confidentiality and privacy of patient information. it is important for healthcare organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect patient data. another concern is the potential for the use of e-health to exacerbate healthcare disparities, as those who are unable to afford or access the necessary technology may be left behind. ensuring that e-health technologies are accessible and affordable to all is an important consideration as the use of e-health continues to grow.    in conclusion, by 2030 it is likely that e-health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare. the increased access to care and improved efficiency provided by e-health technologies have the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry and improve health outcomes for individuals and populations. however, it is important to consider and address potential challenges and drawbacks, such as cybersecurity concerns and healthcare disparities, as the use of e-health continues to grow.",41,13,0.5185185089163239,0.16770186335403728,3.156862745098039,0.0655775928651579,1.2889761351852789,21.11598490258084,322,3.2080745341614905,0,7.645962732919255
32449.0,"the covid 19 pandemic has reshaped the fundamental fabric of our world. initiating in china in late december 2019, the virus has since then spread to every corner of the world, infecting millions in its wake. countries around the world have responded by shutting down their economies and advocating lockdowns of varying degrees. india has arguably had one of the most stringent lockdowns of all countries, restricting the movement of people, goods and effectively transforming every city into a ghost town.    due to such stringent restrictions on movement, the economy has received a fatal blow. the virus arrived in india at a time when the country was already in strife, dealing with a slowing gdp growth rate and an ever-increasing fiscal deficit. the lockdown has simply exacerbated the economic predicament; pushing multiple businesses and industries to a moribund state. other countries have also faced a similar predicament, particularly in the us and europe, both being hotspots for virus transmission.    however, upon taking a closer look at the global economy, there seems to have been an upward mobilization in some of the sectors in the it domain. these sectors seem to have exorbitantly increased their scale of operations and have overall reaped hefty profits. so what is it that differentiates these areas from the rest and what can we learn from them?    a path to victory    if we look at the evolving it/ites industry around the world, the domains that have flourished in this strenuous time all have had one key characteristic in common; flexibility. these sectors have adopted a more flexible approach to dealing with the lockdown. be it flexible working procedures or adopting newer, more advanced ways of working in line with the requirements of our time, they haven’t shied away from changing the rules of the game. let’s look at some of these areas within the tech domain that have been successful in conquering the lockdown.    social media    lockdowns around the globe have confined people inside their homes, with nothing much to do of significance. as a result, social networking sites have reported a gigantic rise in user engagement over the lockdown period. reportedly, there has been close to a 50% rise in daily text transmissions across messaging platforms such as facebook, instagram, and whatsapp in the hardest-hit economies. twitter has reported a 23% increase in its user base as compared to last year. the data makes it evident that social media platforms are here to reap the benefits of a lockdown situation.    video consumption sites such as youtube, instagram, and tiktok are in line to reap massive profits. it’s no wonder that viewership on these platforms has increased manifolds due to lockdowns. these platforms serve to be a distraction from the tragedies of the real world in such stressing times and offer an easy escape. be it rumors regarding the cure for covid 19, gossips, or rap battles; these platforms provide viewers with their much-needed dose of distractions. as they say, “ignorance is bliss”.    data-mining enterprises    the lockdown has proven to be a miracle for data-mining companies. with such an exorbitant increase in the number of hours spent online globally, these firms now have access to significantly larger sets of data than they otherwise could ever have. widespread implementation of data-mining has been seen recently with most countries opting for government-regulated surveillance applications that monitor your movement at all times. moreover, these applications have access to your personal information as well as medical records. countries such as south korea and singapore are at the helm of relying on such means to control the outbreak.    although noble, such initiatives do raise a red flag with regards to user privacy. the public has been provided with very little information about how these applications operate and what goes on behind the scenes. this creates an atmosphere of obscurity that is frankly harmful to the premise of a democracy.    cloud computing    cloud computing has been on the rise for the last couple of years. however, the pandemic has made it the de facto king in terms of computational services. with an increasing reliance on remote working, the ability to store data in one secure location has turned out to be critical.    the cloud computing services such as amazon web services, microsoft azure, and google cloud have reaped hefty profits in the process. the emerging landscape in the tech world seems to suggest an upward trend in reliability on these services as far as large scale data storage and computing is concerned.    e-commerce    social distancing measures have made it practically impossible for people to physically go shopping for groceries and other necessities. moreover, a majority of retail outlets in cities have reported negligible engagement, for the fear of transmission of the virus. e-commerce sites have been the real winners in this predicament of global consumerism.    with high standards of hygiene and at-home delivery, these sites have provided an easy alternative to retail stores. other similar businesses include food delivery apps and grocery sites that are also flourishing today amidst the pandemic. recent weeks have made it evident that e-commerce websites are well on their way to abolish traditional shopping methods.    ott platforms    online streaming platforms consist of a relatively newer approach to entertainment; having only been in existence for the past couple of years. they had already, however, established a name for themselves before the lockdowns. sites such as netflix and amazon prime had been dominating a chunk of the market share and competing heavily with movie theatres for new releases, for a while now. now with the lockdown practically deleting theatres and cable tv from the collective psyche of the entertainment industry, they are well on their way to becoming the platform of choice as far as entertainment for the masses is concerned.    this has already become evident, with zee5 india reporting a whopping 80% increase in subscriptions and a 50% increase in the time spent on their site, within the first couple of weeks of the lockdown itself. another such platform mubi reported a 28% rise in its viewership in india only a week after lockdown commenced. these facts are a clear indication of the exponential growth that is in store for these platforms, which is unlikely to change anytime soon.    video-conferencing platforms    the idea of working from home is all set to be the new norm in our professional culture, which requires an easy and effective way to communicate over the internet. not just audio or text, but video conferencing is the need today. hence it’s understandable why multiple video conferencing services are set to reap massive profits off of the new norm.    arguably the most popular of these, zoom has reported a 130% increase in its price share since the beginning of 2020. another such platform known as the microsoft teams collaboration suite, operated by microsoft, has reported a whopping 12 million increase in its user base in the very first week of the lockdown in the us. this data is only likely to have an upwards trajectory considering the increasing pace at which industries are going online.    the indian picture    the indian it landscape has also undergone massive cultural changes. according to rajesh gopinathan, chief executive officer and managing director of tata consultancy services ltd., the “work from home” model of operations is here to stay. he also claimed that the firms only requires a 25% workforce to be physically present for any project at any of the locations.    tata consultancy services which is one of the major players in the indian it landscape has shifted almost 90% of its workforce into a remote borderless workspace model, and other smaller firms have followed suit. what it tells us is that we’re headed in a direction we’re unlikely to return from. remote working appears to be the modern protocol for operations and is unlikely to change anytime soon.    however, a major challenge often overlooked in such circumstances is that of an adaptable culture. the culture of workspaces has to be drastically altered and members of the workforce have to dive headfirst into the new way of doing business. this is critical to ensure that the industry can combat the pandemic and recover gloriously.    a duality unlike any other    the lockdown has presented us with a stark contrast unlike any other we’ve witnessed. where on the one hand, the industries mentioned above seem to be exhibiting exponential growth with their people thriving and having every possible resource at their disposal, the unorganized sector and the msmes (micro, small and medium enterprises) seem to be at the crux of death.    the sector that consists of people for whom having guidelines to work from home is irrelevant as that was never really an option; people with no fixed wages or social security to fall back on during this time of crisis. as a result of the lockdown, several of these msmes have effectively become inoperable and have resorted to massive layoffs just to survive. this has resulted in thousands of workers losing their jobs with nowhere to go to for refuge. a chunk of these people includes migrant workers who have lost their jobs and are left with little to no avenue to feed themselves. not receiving significant support from the government, these people have been initiating treks back to their villages. what is witnessed is a massive influx of migrant workers flooding the highways, walking weeks to find shelter and food. truck drivers responsible for delivering goods have also resigned stating that they have no means to eat because of the closure of every food joint on the highways. both these realities present a stark contrast and expose a deep crack in our societal framework. one i reckon won’t heal anytime soon.    a train unlikely to halt    the covid 19 pandemic has restructured our social fabric in a way that is unlikely to change anytime soon. the areas that we’ve discussed are likely to become the flagbearers of the digital revolution of the decade. an upward mobilization with regards to massive scale movement of industries online seems pertinent today being led by these domains in the it industry. an unfortunate consequence of it is that a majority of the msmes may soon cease to exist, having been replaced by some of the other alternatives that we’ve discussed. it seems to be a never-ending circle where the ones who are making a profit out of this situation will continue to do so, while the others will be washed out from our collective memory.",40,54,-0.14893616862833864,0.10151187904967603,9.07843137254902,0.10492414858425264,3.673342208453309,97.15976158901795,926,2.698704103671706,4,6.801295896328294
32910.8,"introduction 
 
 
 
 a video game is any software program that can be played on a computing device, such as a personal computer, gaming console, or mobile device. video games have been in existence since the early 1970s and have become increasingly popular, spanning different mobile (smartphones, tablets) and stationary (computer or console) platforms. advances, particularly in mobile devices, have given birth to social networks and group gaming
 
 
 
 although the nature of gaming does not require physical stamina and therefore is not limited by factors such as age, gender, or fitness, it is most popular with adolescents. in 2018, the world health organization (who) classified gaming disorder in their international classification of diseases (icd-11). the icd-11 is a list of diseases and medical conditions that aids health professionals in making diagnoses and treatment plans for patients having various disorders. it should be noted that, the inclusion of gaming disorder in the icd-11 by who has generated vigorous and sometimes contentious debate and discussion within the medical and mental health community. although recognized as an area of clinical interest, the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm-5) published by the american psychiatric association suggests that more clinical research is required before gaming disorder is formally considered as a psychiatric disorder. similarly, the who notes the inclusion of gaming disorder in icd-11, to encourage more research into excessive gaming behavior, including its prevention and treatment.
 
 
 
 what is online gaming disorder?
 
 
 
 2018 who draft 11th revision of the icd-11 denotes the disorder as a pattern of “digital-gaming” or “video-gaming” behavior characterized by impaired control over gaming activity, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and the continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.
 
 
 
 online gaming disorder has the same similarities with internet gaming disorder (igd), which is a condition that the american psychiatric association (apa) noted in dsm-5 as an area in need of additional study. the apa does not currently recognize igd as an official condition. for gaming disorder to be diagnosed, the who criteria require that the behavioral pattern of the gamer must be of sufficient severity that major and noticeable impairment and deterioration in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning is present for a minimum of 12 months.
 
 
 
 signs and symptoms of online gaming disorder
 
 
 
 according to the who definition, a person with online gaming disorder will demonstrate the following characteristics for at least 12 months; problems controlling control their gaming habits, seeing gaming as more important over other necessities and daily activities or work, continuing to engage in gaming even after its negative health and social problems has been identified or are evident. further research shows that gaming disorders can also be linked to anxiety, depression, obesity, sleeping disorders, and stress. people who remain physically inactive for long periods because of gaming may also be at higher risk of obesity, sleep disorders, and other health-related issues, according to who [1].
 
 
 
 health consequences of video online gaming
 
 
 
 video game-related health problems can cause continuous strain injuries, skin disorders, and other health issues. other problems according to shoja et al. (2007), include a condition that could be termed video game-provoked seizures in patients with pre-existing epilepsy. the following health consequences of video gaming have been reported.
 
 
 
 vision issues
 
 
 
 video game playing is associated with eye problems. extensive and fixed staring at a video game screen causes eyestrain because the cornea, pupil, and iris are not biologically equipped for chronic heavy viewing of digital images from electronic devices. the visual system strain from frequent video game use over extended periods may result in headaches, dizziness, and in some cases, nausea and vomiting. interestingly, there is some research that shows that gamers have an enhancement of spatial distribution of attention, compared with non-gamers. this somewhat predictable practice effect occurs with both peripheral and central visual attention. for sufferers of amblyopia (dimness or blurring of the eyesight due to a fault in transmission from the eye to the brain) video games may be helpful.
 
 
 
 musculoskeletal problems
 
 
 
 persistent gamers may also suffer from musculoskeletal problems. a survey of children indicated increased physical complaints associated with video game playing. such complaints range from pain in the hands and wrists to back and neck. furthermore, a case report involving a nine-year-old teenager referenced playstation thumb. playstation thumb is, characterized by numbness and a blister is caused by friction between the thumb and the controller from rapid and persistent gameplay. using dermoscopy, dermatologists discovered hemorrhages and onycholysis (the loosening or separation of a fingernail) in a patient who presented with hyperkeratosis. also, tendon injuries (tendinosis) of the hands and wrists from tendon overuse, is another health problem associated with video game playing. furthermore, another case report in the new england journal of medicine reported a fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal from people who play wii video games. this condition has been termed (perhaps sarcastically), a wii fracture. there are also postural problems associated with the persistent playing of video games, although, ergonomic measures (including chair to monitor position) could potentially improve postural problems associated with video game playing.
 
 
 
 obesity and overweight
 
 
 
 playing video games consistently has been associated with obesity. this is maybe related to the lack of physical activity in players. alternatively, it could be that those who are less physically fit because of obesity gravitate towards less physically demanding activities, such as gaming. in either case, several studies have linked television and video games and increased body mass index (bmi). it has been estimated that children in the united states spend 25% of their waking hours watching either television or playing video games. furthermore, children who watch the most hours of television or play video games have the highest incidence of obesity. if video games are replacing physical activities and young people do not participate in physical recreation or see playing of video games as a form of recreation, this may be part of the link between times spent while playing video games and a rise in bmi in teenagers. evidence for this potential link gains some support from a german study reporting that boys who spend no more than 1.5 hours per day engaged in television watching or playing video games, were 75.4% less likely to be overweight than those who spend more than 1.5 hours engaged in the same activity.
 
 
 
 in a 2011 study, an association between video game activity and an increase of (mostly junk) food intake was reported. specifically, single video game sessions caused an increase in food intake, regardless of appetite. it has also been suggested that active video game play using two popular gaming platforms has the opposite effect. other researchers found no evidence that more active video games would result in a beneficial outcome although the study did demonstrate an increase in the amount of physical activity within the children receiving the active video games.
 
 
 
 seizures (epileptic)
 
 
 
 health concerns that video games may cause epileptic seizures started in the early 1980s. the first medically documented case of a video game-induced seizure was reported in 1981. in 1993, a story in the popular press (sun newspaper) reported that a boy choked to death on his own vomit during a seizure triggered by playing a video game. similar but less serious incidents were subsequently reported by news media around the world, ultimately motivating video game console manufacturers to include that epilepsy warnings in the instruction manuals for their gaming products. in 1994 it was reported that video games only cause seizures in people already predisposed to epilepsy and advised that people with a predisposition to epilepsy can greatly reduce the risk of a seizure by staying 10 feet or more away from the tv set and wearing sunglasses while playing video games. this is clearly an area in need of additional research.
 
 
 
 prevention and treatment of online gaming disorder
 
 
 
 the cost: benefit value of prevention versus treatment of addiction disorders has been known for many years. it is important and beneficial to make use of several types of strategies in combating gaming addictiveness or disorder. effective strategies include: educating gamers about gaming behaviors and consequences on their mental health; treatment geared towards helping the gamer to control his/her urge for video games, recognizing and dealing with disturbing thoughts and learning how to cope without video games; intrapersonal and interpersonal counseling to help gamers to explore their identity, build self-esteem, and enhance their emotional intelligence outside the fictional world of gaming and learning communication and assertiveness skills needed in social interactions; family involvement, including counseling and discussion family and other relationships; and developing new lifestyles. the latter is particularly important and to paraphrase the well-known mantra of alcoholics anonymous, it’s all about, people, places, and things. to prevent the persistent playing of video games, people need to explore new activities, set new goals and metrics of achievements beyond video game scores.",30,68,-0.38775509808413167,0.10629067245119306,9.03921568627451,0.10929598810859649,3.659404669753243,100.77090103612596,922,2.905639913232104,0,7.06290672451193
3355.6,"introduction    the phrase “e-health” refers to “internet medicine” as well as almost everything else connected to computers and healthcare. it appears that industry leaders and marketing professionals, not academics, were the first to adopt the word. to bring the promises, principles, and excitement (and hype) surrounding e-commerce (electronic commerce) to the health arena and to give an account of the new possibilities the internet is opening up for the area of health care, they created and used this term in line with other “e-words” such as e-commerce, e-business, e-solutions, and so on.    e-health emerged in the modern world as a result of the demand for better patient tracking of their healthcare and operations, notably for purposes of reimbursement from organizations like insurance companies. in the past, healthcare professionals kept paper records of the patient’s history and current condition. however, the development of an electronic tracking system was pushed by rising healthcare expenses and technological advancements. the field of telemedicine, in which a telecommunications medium is utilized to deliver medical care remotely, evolved as e-health technology advanced.    growth of e-health    the e-health industry saw tremendous expansion following the epidemic, with several new companies being created as “buddies” for e-health treatment. such as the market leaders in a positive way right now, oura health, vantage health, mendelian, and healthifyme. they target those who are looking for economical healthcare facilities by offering e-health at lower prices. accessibility from the east is another aspect of e-health care brands. some benefits of e-health care facilities include quality, improved doctor-patient relationships, a wider audience, better communication, tracking of health, and convenience of follow-ups.    impact of technology on e-health    the recently introduced 5g services will present an ocean of chances for e-health services, according to a study by “ey.” in addition to accelerating the deployment of telemedicine, 5g may improve the interaction between health sensors, algorithms, and smart gadgets.    in 2021, the size of the global e-health market was estimated at usd 97,640.4 million. by 2030, it is anticipated to reach usd 338,147.7 million, expanding at a cagr of 14.8% over the forecast period (2022-2030). as we can see, the fast-expanding e-health sector is changing how healthcare is provided. this caused a large portion of the population to switch from conventional healthcare practices to electronic health. now, more and more nations are looking for a digital strategy. the market is expanding as a result of rising government measures to encourage e-health solutions, an increase in chronic diseases, and a growing requirement to employ e-health to manage regulatory compliance.    rise of e-health in today’s world    according to a poll of more than 11,000 consumers across 16 nations, consumers still view health and fitness as “essentials,” right up there with groceries and domestic cleaning supplies, even in the face of general insecurity and financial difficulties. 80% of poll participants indicated they intended to maintain or increase their spending on areas connected to health and fitness in the coming year, such as exercise classes or vitamins and supplements, even though two-thirds (66%) of respondents stated they feel financially stressed.    source: accenture consumer public survey    regardless of income levels, people have redefined health and well-being as essential goods and intend to maintain or increase their spending in this area this year, according to oliver wright, a senior managing director at accenture and the global leader of the company’s consumer goods & services industry practice. “with the global spend on health and wellness expected to reach more than $1 trillion by 2025, consumer-facing companies must draw on cross-industry expertise, scientific advancements, and technological innovations while also taking consumers’ shifting priorities into account when developing new offerings.” thus, as health requirements rise along with innovation, people are more tolerant of e-health.    source: deloitte    healthcare customers desire both easy access to medical care and positive interactions with their doctors. however, if forced to pick one, they would go with convenience. to address this, more than half of the survey participants expressed interest in implementing solutions that would enhance the consumer experience by lowering the time and difficulty associated with obtaining care. in fact, over the next three to five years, 61% of respondents intend to spend money on patient communication technologies like telehealth and messaging capabilities with their medical staff. other consumer-specific capabilities that businesses are wanting to invest in at this time include online appointment scheduling and virtual registration.    future of e-health and its role in the pandemic    the system of e-health relies on interoperable digital systems to exchange information on health operations, and in the future, information from these systems might be exchanged between other nations to enhance healthcare administration. this enables inhabitants of one country who travel elsewhere for a vacation to receive better healthcare and medicine prescriptions there. additionally, this will help the medical tourism sector as well.    robotics and artificial intelligence will be used more frequently in the future. even though it will be difficult in the future for robots to operate on people, doctors are now utilizing ai to diagnose illnesses. the goal of digital healthcare in the future is to put medical facilities close to the people. m-health technologies can track patients’ vital signs and keep an eye out for anomalies. so that consumers can consult a doctor before the issue worsens this lowers the fatality rate and medical malpractice.    the covid-19 pandemic has already demonstrated the value of e-health technology since most hospitals were operating at limited capacity and postponing procedures as a result. as a result, during the epidemic, e-health applications were employed to maintain communication and improve patient care. all of this technology was, however, interoperable and required fast internet connections. to reduce the distance between doctors and patients, internet penetration would rise in the future, for instance with today’s 5g technology.    summing it up    last but not least, a stronger push for digital health may increase confidence in digital healthcare and increase dependence on medical websites. the vaccination movement, which is highly vocal and gaining traction through digital channels, is an example of this. the relationship between the medical staff and the patient is ultimately what drives health and wellness, but in today’s environment, digital platforms are supporting this interaction more than ever. the future standard of treatment might very well include the routine use of digital health instruments.",45,10,0.6363636247933887,0.0888529886914378,6.068627450980392,0.09180863001122105,2.4641744323966455,56.82954197694583,619,2.9095315024232633,0,7.303715670436187
34296.2,"the pandemic has shaken the world in the way one had hardly imagined. the impact of it on jobs and services is going to be long-lasting and it will be the foundation stone of revolution in these sectors. with the work from home and social distancing norms is altering the way of work, the way we interact, what work we will do, how the work will be done, and whatnot. to just give an example, in the middle of the first lockdown, fmcg major hindustan unilever (hul) went ahead with its merger. it took place online entirely. yes, it took place online. who could have ever imagined the merger can take place online?    change is inevitable. but some changes are temporary and some are permanent. the pandemic is bringing changes that are going to be permanent. in fact, these changes were due for a long time and we’re coming at a slow pace. what the pandemic has done is, it has become the catalyst for these changes and raised the ante for change. so, what exactly the changes will be? let’s look at them one by one.    the first change is going to be the extensive use of digital communication from now onwards. the zoom, jio meet, google meet, and some derivatives like these are going to be the forever meeting rooms where the important discussions will be held. this may be bad news for the employees who are older than 40 years. they would not have pictured themselves doing such transformation at this part of life. experts believe that the new normal in the offices are going to be hierarchy-less. the older employees would have to work with the younger ones. there would be no geographical boundaries and where the communication and software adaptability among employees is going to be crucial. the symbol of power will be less visible and the decentralization of power in the office will be prominent. there will be more egalitarianism in companies. the corporates will think much more about office space. rather than expending too much on physical infrastructure, the online infrastructure will always be in their hindsight. the impact would be more prudent in small and mid-sized businesses. the physical offices itself might disappear from such businesses. but it’s not going to be easy for companies. the security and confidentiality of the authentic information going out of the offices’ building are going to be the largest concern in the new normal world. there would be no surprise if a lot of start-ups will bloom in the near future providing software for security for the data and information of the companies. also, travel is going to be reduced. so, the major component of ctc where the companies fooling the employees must find the other way.    the second change is going to be struck down on employees. already many of the companies and start-ups are reducing the workforce. it is expected that new normal offices would work with an 80% workforce of that of the current workforce. automation is on the verge. due to safety reasons, the companies are going to be more and more leaned towards automation with a minimal touch of human possible. this might result in a loss of jobs in some sectors, but it will also create new jobs in the automation sector. it was evident from before pandemic too but now the velocity for the same would be increased. in the new normal tech-enabled world, the job which would be at stake dominantly would be managers’ managers. the it firms have started firing the vice presidents and assistant vice presidents who draw hefty salaries but don’t really drive the business. in the designation-less set up in the near future accelerated by pandemic, they automatically become redundant. for the first time, the employees might be given jobs that would require more than the standard jobs. also, when the workforce in the company would be less in the company, the employees might be given the option of working for extra time or working on the weekends and would be incentivized for the same rather than employing more staff and paying them full salary. it is a win-win situation for both employees and companies. employees can earn more than what they usually earn and will get to learn new which would be out of their primary domain. the companies would be able to keep their costs low through this. the assessment of employees might change too. rather than going for an annual performance review, the employees might be evaluated based on the tasks they perform. creativity and innovation are going to be swords for the employees in the new normal world rather than designations in the office.      the other change might be in the services sector. the services like which involves maximum human touch will be the one which will be affected most adversely. the safety concerns and confidence of people over the system are going to be the issue for at least the next few years. it also opens the opportunity for something very new. the products which could replace the need for visiting such services centers are going to create a boom in the market. according to mckinsey, the sales for such products are multiplying rapidly.    there are speculations that the economies will tend to become minimalist economies. let’s dig deep into this. minimalist economies are the economies where people tend to refrain from purchasing luxurious items and focuses on purchasing necessities more and more.  well, this is the position we are in right now during the pandemic. people are expensing only necessary items like groceries and the demand for luxurious items is way below average. but it would be hard to stay the same as this. the minimalist economy will result in the deterioration of the economy in the short term. it is true that in the minimalist economy the demand might be low, but it would be wrong to assume the demand will be zero. the high-quality products will gather the attention of the purchasers. it is evident from past experiences that the economy always finds its way to come back from the mode of minimalist economy. though this time may take some time, it will surely return on track.    but every trouble comes with an opportunity. this is the time for the companies to act now and grab the opportunities the pandemic has brought with him. but for that companies are required to follow plans, formulate strategies to suit their needs, and pay more attention to the innovation. the companies must form plans for the five stages from here. these stages are 5rs: resolve, resilience, return, reimagination, and reform.    resolve: in the resolve phase companies need to formulate a nerve center to combat corvid itself. the tendency of the company should not be like that, they will return only after everything becomes normal. in most parts of the country, permission is granted to the companies for their operations. if they wait for normalcy, then bankruptcy might catch them before the normalcy.    resilience: the resilience phase includes maintaining liquidity, addressing solvency, and grow for sustainability. all businesses should know when their cash crunch is coming. addressing these cash crunches will be crucial for the companies. businesses must take aggressive options to remain solvent. for example, the businesses might have cash in their hand but might be poor in operational efficiency then it requires the attention of the company. organizations solving issues of liquidity and solvency will be in a better position to grow with sustainability.    return: in the third phase of return the companies will have to plan for the time when everything will be back on track. given the possibility of subsequent waves of coronavirus the companies need new ways of working to prevent, identify, report, and contain future flareups. many industries will face this problem of returning. staying prepared for resurgence scenarios should include a multi-scenario modeling exercise. reverting to non-covid-19 care will require extensive planning and market testing.    reimagine: the phase of reimagining will include the learnings from the pandemic. a small virus and the whole economy at the toss. the businesses will have to introspect them and must look for advancements in technologies such that this kind of pandemic in the future will not disturb their efficiency too much. the pandemic has taught us that the decision which took weeks and months in the normal world can be accelerated and can be taken in some days. this should become a permanent feature. cross organizational collaboration has become much easier. this should stay in the long run.    reform: the last phase is the reform. in this phase, the companies should look at their bottlenecks and try to fix them. also, the companies will have to reconsider their relationship with their customers. the confidence in their brands, they must regain it.    there are three ways to shift work, talent, and skills to where and when they are needed most, thereby building the organizational resilience and agility necessary to navigate uncertain times and rebound with strength when the economy recovers.    make work portable:    in this dismal situation it is more important than ever most of the staff should be in the critical tasks. the tasks could be like the customer complaints redressal. we know that the customers are the ones who make the businesses successful. thus, retaining their confidence is the utmost priority. the organizations can convert some of the staff to address the queries and concerns of customers. the organizations require to create virtual offices. there should not be the geographical boundaries within the organization. the employees from all over the world from the organization should come together and take the organization back to pre-corvid state. by breaking out of rigid job constraints, the right talent and work can be matched to solve evolving business challenges in real-time.    accelerate automation:    this was happening before the pandemic too. but accelerating it with pace has now become the need of the hour. the perception that automation is a job-killer is totally wrong and in fact, it is the mandatory capability to deal with the crisis. organizations can increase automation in call centers. this will reduce the response time.    share employees in cross-industry exchanges:    temporarily moving employees from some industries like airlines, restaurants, hospitality can be moved to those organizations which have maximum work at this time like healthcare and logistics.    to conclude, the companies should understand “lives come first, but livelihood matters”. the pandemic will have some adverse effects on jobs and services, but this is not the end. the pandemic has brought many opportunities with him and if they are grabbed then the organizations would be in much better position even compared to pre-corvid situations. the companies need to understand the pandemic is not going to be forever. the last concluding sentence will be corona will bring changes but there will not be a revolution in jobs and services.",51,34,0.19999999764705886,0.09149623250807319,9.107843137254902,0.08597951064542925,3.6775290591601326,79.87496538960377,929,2.672766415500538,1,6.63724434876211
34758.0,"social media is such a staple of our evolving digital culture that it’s almost hard to imagine a time without updates, likes, comments, and shares. people are more concerned about how their food looks than about how it tastes. thus, it has become necessary for any brand to have a social media presence. the phrase “out of sight, out of mind” has never been so apt than in today’s time. social media is as much about engagement with other people as it is about sharing content. it’s why we call it “social” media.    social media engagement simply is the interaction between the customer and the brand on social media platforms. where else are you going to find a huge database of your target demographic who are already in the mind frame to read, click on, and share your message?    in practicality it is not about a one-off communication but more about the construction of a long-term relationship with your target customers. hence, when we talk about such a relationship it is imperative to consider the positive actions of users as a reaction of any brand’s engagement tactics.    a fundamental customer journey can be envisaged in the form of customer funnel. the touchpoints available at every step can be shown as:     awarenessconsideration decisionpurchase post-purchase touchpoints word of mouth, social media, regular advertisements on the customer journey map congruence with perceived and offered benefits, cost-benefit analysis, value propositionplace and time utility, loyalty towards product, switching costs retail/on-portal conversion levers, customer schemes dissonance, purchase complexity     to understand the reach of social media by the use of numbers        most popular social networks worldwide as of july 2020, ranked by number of active users (in millions)    how many retweets on twitter? how many reactions to the post on facebook? how many likes on instagram? how many shares on linked in? this seems to be the new age resume.    thus, a good question or mystery for any brand is how to measure their social media engagement. as with most online actions, it’s often difficult to measure offline benefits. more often than not the online campaigns do not drive any conversions on the same day/week, but a user may see those posts and become more familiar with the brand. that familiarity, later on, might result in him choosing that brand over an unknown competitor. social media engagement as a result helps businesses in developing their brand’s personality, improves visibility, and becomes its voice.    customers exhibit dynamic behavior based on the type of product. it could range from picking and variety-seeking to high involvement processes comprising extensive information search. top of the mind recall rules due to this purchasing behavior implies that targeted advertising and marketing is extremely important. no one engagement strategy can be applied across brands. each brand’s strategy must differ based on what the brand is trying to sell, its target customers, and the beliefs of the brand.    some of the key aspects of marketing strategy that we have influenced as vital cogs in the digital marketing wheel are:    influencer marketing    influencer marketing involves a brand collaborating with an online influencer to market one of its products or services. here the audience doesn’t care much about your brand but the opinions of the influencers.    an influencer as being someone who has:    the power to affect the purchasing decisions of others because of their knowledge, position, authority, or relationship with their audience.    a following in a distinct niche, with whom they regularly engage. the size of the following depends on the size of their topic of the niche.    2017 saw chanel being named as the most influential luxury brand on social media. since then, it has continued to grow and diversify its portfolio, while providing constant engagement to its plethora of followers, especially on instagram.     cross-channel marketing    cross-channel marketing or multi-channel marketing is the practice of using multiple channels to reach an audience. because not everyone uses every single platform, it’s a good idea to have a presence on a few, and share some of the same content across the different networks. what makes a difference in this marketing strategy is the choice of platforms. apart from using basics like facebook, instagram, and twitter a clever use of spotify, youtube, or igtv to showcase the brand can make a real difference.    the luxury vehicle brand, land rover’s cross-channel marketing includes the google display network, homepage masthead and masthead in lightbox ads on youtube, and visibility through mobile, search, and google+. the brand’s digital campaign included four different influencers who created visual content for their blogs by taking trips to places like glacier national park and the appalachian mountains and land rover’s microsite. their cross-channel efforts resulted in 100 million impressions from youtube, and a 10% increase in search ad ctr. further results found that online leads from its digital channel efforts now account for 15% of the brand’s total sales.    informative    the content created on social media must add some value addition to the customers. the brand must constantly keep informing the customers about their existing products, new products, achievements of the brands, or even casual content. there should be “wow, i didn’t know this” factor. only then will they become regular followers of the brand.    an example of this would be a cosmetic brand posting make-up tutorials. fenty beauty is one such prime example, which has built up to 1.4m followers within just 4 days of its launch, eventually garnering close to 10m followers, with rihanna being one of their icons.    involving customers & engaging them:    “customer is king” is a known concept. it is the foundation of traditional marketing. so while we shift to social platforms brands must not forget them. understanding their needs, addressing them, inviting them to respond and take part in the brand’s online activities while keeping it interesting and entertaining for the customer is the key.    founder and ceo of glossier, emily weiss, described the brand as, “the first socially-driven beauty brand.” glossier was certainly the pioneer in the term ‘instagram brands’ – using the platform not only to build awareness but also to have focused conversation with the customer. glossier often crowdsources product development, asking its instagram followers what they’d like to see next.     dynamic    the content creation must be dynamic and suitable for the current season, festival, or event that is happening. people must be able to relate to the posts and they must get excited after seeing it.    starbucks does a marvelous job when it comes to being dynamic. their one-off recipes and continuous hype around seasonal events and related drinks have won them a silver ipa effectiveness award for its social strategy in 2018. the launch of its now iconic ‘unicorn frappuccino’, spurred on the trend of brands deliberately creating ‘instagrammable’ food and drink. as a result, there are now 557,232 posts using the hashtag #pumpkinspicelatte.    product focussed    now of course the real motive behind any marketing activity is to eventually sell the product. so it becomes extremely important to not lose the essence of the product while marketing. in simple terms, the content or strategy must not leave the customer confused about what the brand actually does or what it is trying to sell.    to support the product-centric statement, oreo is the best example. oreo’s social media strategy has never diverged from its original formula. completely product-focused and yet always creative, the brand continuously finds ways to put its cookies center stage. the ‘daily twist’ campaign to mark its 100th birthday, saw the brand turn its oreo cookie into something of cultural relevance for 100 days, including elvis presley, a baseball, and a rainbow flag in support of pride.     visuals    “a picture is worth 1,000 words”. this adage has never been more apt than in the age of social media.  this is why visuals are so important in any marketing strategy. you can talk about a product all day, but until you’re able to put it in front of someone’s eyes, it’s not going to have nearly the same effect. visual content marketing is a great way to make this happen and can be broken down into six basic types- comics, memes, infographics, photos, videos and visual note-taking.    coca-cola has been a leader and trendsetter in the visual content marketing space for years. the 2020 initiative video paved the way for multiway communication, as opposed to the single way process that was prevalent.     product demonstration:    the barrier for electronic platforms has always been the loss of touch. customers often complain that till they don’t touch, try or test the product they are not convinced if they want to purchase it. this can also be true for products that are new and the customers need to be educated about its use. hence it becomes important for brands to bridge this gap as far as possible through their online medium.    product demonstrations are considered one of the most promising and upcoming applications of ar technology, giving brands a way to provide an immersive experience to consumers. gucci partnered with snapchat for the first global branded ar shoe try on the lens, hugely increasing fanfare!    social message    corporate social responsibility should not be missed when it comes to social media engagement. if a brand has the reach to spread awareness then they must use it. creating content to spread social awareness adds an emotional touch too. if a customer connects with a brand on an emotional level its hard for competitors to break it.    dove’s steady and impactful social message still stands out as marketing that’s more than just marketing. the ‘real beauty’ campaign has been refreshed multiple times since it first launched in 2004. dove’s latest campaign once again highlighted the core message, going far beyond surface aesthetic to focus on the beauty of real human values. the ‘courage is beautiful’ campaign successfully honored the healthcare workers who have been working selflessly throughout the 2020 pandemic.    the fact remains that the share of mind and voice are key elements to being the dominant force in the world today. social media marketing has leveraged all the elements and made its presence felt in every customer engagement. finding unique ways to really stand out among the competition is key to a successful digital marketing strategy. newer and more customized tools to feel the pulse of the market come up every single day, to meet the ever-changing needs of marketing heads. at the end of the day, ‘customer is indeed king’. and companies would do well to remember it!",62,16,0.5897435821827746,0.0788675429726997,9.696078431372548,0.07140671223094971,3.9069940574413993,70.62123839640927,989,2.5824064711830133,0,6.577350859453994
35219.8,"petty entrepreneurs like streetside food stalls form an essential part of an economy that plays a significant role in balancing the development of a nation’s economy. the importance of street food vendors not only helps in increasing the country’s per capita income but also helps to make a living for the unemployed in society with a limited investment. most of them are the sole breadwinners for their families. so, with the covid-19 wreaking havoc, the uncertainty of the lockdown policies increased the concern of people over hygiene and the lack of investment to upgrade their businesses to provide better hygiene facilities that can take away food from their mouths.    various states have provided relief packages and support but, in a country, as populous as ours, it has hardly been appropriately implemented. delhi, for instance, recently announced a rupee 500 million stimulus package to nearly 500,000 rupees, recognizing the severe consequences of the loss of livelihoods. the seller’s intended remedy is a credit loan that provides all sellers with an initial working capital of rs 10,000, but this is not enough. instead of loans, the government should consider converting them directly into income benefits, cash subsidies to secure a livelihood in order to initiate income-generating activities on a regular basis. sellers need income support to get back to work, and if they can’t, they will never be able to repay the loan amount. in an ever-changing crisis, organizations need to take a step forward and ensure that providers are provided with the resources they need to make a living. pandemics have had a vast economic impact on every sector, but the most vulnerable sectors, such as street vendors, suffer the most. decreased income can affect most necessities, such as payments to family and yourself. due to a lack of fixed salaries, stalls cannot quit their jobs. if possible, it might be only a few days, unlike regular employees. for them, the risk of infection is far less frightening than hunger.   unlike many of the businesses, most of these food vendors lack the infrastructure to go online and sell products through platforms like swiggy or zomato.   “regret not going digital before,” says dilip das, a street side food stall owner at sector v, kolkata. dilip das used to run a small streetside food stall that provided meals to all the employees around the area which is filled with multinational companies. it was a booming business till the arrival of covid. then with the lockdown arriving, almost all the companies opted for work from home policies. dilip tried to start deliveries, but with a lack of support and fear of infection, that business ended before it even started.   citing similar reasons, swapan mondal, who runs a south indian food stall at park street said that he did know how to operate a smartphone. and since sales were good, he did not care about learning either. but with the implementation of lockdown which took place within 4 hours, people like swapan barely had time to cope with the changes.   furthermore, the covid 19 pandemic made people realize how important trains are in our life. with most of the train network suspended, the entire supply chain was disrupted. hundreds of quintals of food products rotted away, awaiting the logistical issues to fix. many businesses could not afford to run without proper supplies as well.   to handle such issues, vendors organizations may consider the following solutions:   promotion of livelihood for all vendors, including sellers of non-essential goods   the impact of covid19 was extremely severe for informal workers who ran out of capital and income and to try to feed themselves during this long embargo. sellers need to be able to resume sales in order to survive, and governments need to take steps to reopen the market and bring sellers back to the business.   reopening of markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene   india has different types of traditionally crowded markets, even weekly markets (fresh food, cooked food, and essentials) and daily roadside markets. these markets have to reopen with the need for social distance in mind, and the government needs to publish guidelines for that. in the future, sales areas will also need to be designed with social distance and the need for adequate sanitation (running water, wash areas, toilets) in mind. authorities need to work with the town bending commission (tvc).   provision of direct support that is devoid of existing registration requirements   once the restrictions are lifted and the impact of covid 19 is somewhat manageable, sellers who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to help them to return to work. the government initiative is a welcome move, but not in terms of the type of bailout and eligibility is enough. in addition, there are very few registered providers in india, so government relief and support must be separated from the very strict registration requirements. in delhi alone,  of the approximately 300,000 street vendors, only approximately 13100 have some sort of professional id. if all types of cash grants or livelihood support standards relate to job identification by the state,  the government must also accept registration with workers’ organizations/unions on behalf of government-issued sales badges.   ensuring social distancing and proper sanitation and hygiene at sites of businesses   the government and municipal corporations need to take the initiative and running water, and soap/sanitizers need to be provided for street vendors at their place of work. moreover, the streetside food vendors should work with food safety authorities in the country to train themselves in different ways to maintain hygiene whilst working.   taking steps to spread awareness of different government initiatives and reliefs   many small businessmen and food vendors do not even know their rights and the benefits they can claim. if they did, many still have no idea about how to claim them. proper awareness camps need to be set up to help these small-time food vendors to know how they can get assistance and help from the government and return back to the business.   when covid was an unknown word, these shopkeepers and vendors brought the taste to our mouth, gave us memories to live for, filled our bellies, and quenched our thirst when we needed them. it’s time to provide them with a hand now when they need

35681.6,"the coronavirus, also known as covid-19, is not only a global public health emergency but also a source of significant regional and increasingly global economic disruption. this impacts the energy and climate world in many ways. the economic downturn puts pressure on global oil prices leading the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) to consider further cuts to production. it hurts the demand for natural gas during a time of extremely low prices. it changes the economic, energy, and climate policymaking environment in china, one of the most consequential energy consumers and sources of greenhouse gas emissions. and it has temporarily disrupted supply chains throughout the energy industry, including renewable energy, at a time when supply chain connections with china were being revaluated due to ongoing tariff and trade disputes. how consequential or transformative any of these changes are for the energy sector or for climate efforts will depend upon the ultimate trajectory of the virus outbreak itself    — sarah ladislaw, senior vice president and director, energy security and climate change program    the energy sector has already felt the impacts of the coronavirus. the outbreak has contributed to a dampened demand for oil, resulting in plummeting oil prices and production declines. as we move forward, then, the energy sector expects to face two headwinds: managing the issues of the health emergency all sectors face, and simultaneously coping with a low oil-price scenario, lower demand and the need to shore up revenue and manage debt obligations.                                   impact of covid-19 on indian energy markets    in india, distribution utilities have a lower tariff for domestic and agricultural consumers, sometimes even below the average cost of supply, as compared to that for commercial and industrial consumers. table 1 provides the electricity tariff rates in delhi for selected consumer categories to highlight these differences. thus, for several distribution companies, the lower tariff-paying consumers are cross-subsidized by commercial and industrial consumers.    categoryfixed charge (₹

electricity regulatory commission (derc)        the covid-19 lockdown has led to shut down of all but essential commercial activities across the country. approximately 1.3 billion citizens are obliged to remain within the confines of their homes and, in many cases, only allowed to work from home. consequently, the electricity demand from industrial and, commercial customers has reduced significantly while the residential demand is expected to have increased. according to the power system operation corporation of india (posoco), the energy met on march 16th, 2020 – which can be considered as a business-as-usual scenario – was 3494 mu as compared to 3113 mu on march 23rd, 2020 a day of voluntary curfew. it further reduced to a range between 2600-2800 mu between march 25th to march 31st, 2020. this trend is illustrated in the below figure 1.    figure1: daily energy met (mu)    thus, firstly, a key risk from the covid-19 pandemic for the already struggling distribution companies in india arises from the loss of revenues due to the reduction of demand from the commercial and industrial customers as well as the inability to cover the cross-subsidies provided to the lower-tariff paying consumer. secondly, the utilities would also have to account for the expense to comply with any ‘must buy’ commitments that they have with generators with long-term power purchase agreements. the true and full extent of this risk would only be known once a quantitative analysis is conducted when this crisis situation is contained. thirdly, at an operational level, distribution companies would have to account for deviation in demand and supply patterns at a temporal and locational level. finally, during this period, critical infrastructure such as electricity networks would have to be run with minimum employees.    covid-19 impact on the power market    as seen in figure 1, the trade on the wholesale power market comprises just 4.3 percent of the total electricity transactions. however, the transactions through the power exchanges have grown over the last decade. the indian energy exchange (iex) has seen a growth from 2616 mu in fy 2009 to 52,241 in fy 2019.    figure2: share of market segments in total electricity generation 2018-19 (source: cerc)         until now, the trade in the wholesale market is in four market segments:    1) day-ahead market     2) term ahead market     3) renewable energy certificates    4) energy-saving certificates.     recently, the central electricity regulatory commission (cerc) finalized the regulations for implementing real-time markets. this half-hourly market will enable the intra-day trade of electricity, allowing adjustment of generation and consumption profile during the day. before the covid-19 pandemic, it was announced by cerc that the real-time market would be operational from april 1st, 2020. however, the starting date has now been delayed by two months to june 1st, 2020. according to media reports, due to the covid-19 pandemic, some required trials could not be completed. this delay in the real-time market implementation is likely to have a serious, adverse impact on the indian power market.    another impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the power markets is in terms of the market dynamic. it can be observed that there is a dip in the clearing volume and the market-clearing price, which coincides with the gradually increasing shutdown measures taken by the government as a response to covid-19 (see figure 2). thus, the reduction in demand due to the lockdown is reflected in the volumes traded on the electricity market and the clearing price.    another point of reference is the price and clearing volume in 2019. on march 22nd, 2020, the day of voluntary lockdown, the clearing volume was 97.05 gwh, and the clearing price was 2195.48 ₹ /mwh. in comparison, on the same day in 2019, the clearing volume was 107.98 gwh, and the clearing price was 2816.18 ₹ /mwh. from the start of the lockdown, from march 25nd to april 1st 2020, the average clearing volume was 104.27 gwh compared to 130.24 gwh in 2019 during the same period. similarly, the average market clearing price was 2155.93 ₹ /mwh in 2020 as compared to 3371.025 ₹ /mwh in 2019 for the same period.                                  views of the shareholders in india    the lockdown has resulted in a shutdown of the industrial and commercial establishments and the stoppage of passenger railway services. this has adversely impacted the all india electricity demand, given that these segments constitute about 40% of the all india electricity demand, a statement issued by the rating firm said.    further, these segments account for an even greater percentage of the discoms sales revenues given that they are the subsidizing segments. this apart, with the focus of state governments being on healthcare and relief measures, the likelihood of subsidy support to the discoms getting deferred cannot be ruled out, it added.    icra ratings group head and senior vice president – corporate ratings sabyasachi majumdar said, “the lockdown imposed by the government is likely to adversely impact the all india electricity demand, with demand expected to decline by about 20-25% on a year-on-year basis during the period of lockdown. this would in turn adversely impact the revenues and cash collections for distribution utilities in the near term, especially given the consumption decline from the high tariff paying industrial and commercial consumers and likely delays in cash collections from other consumer segments. the revenue deficit for the discoms is estimated to be about rs. 130 billion per month, on an all india basis. this would in turn adversely impact the liquidity profile of the discoms, increase their subsidy requirement, and lead to delays in payments to the power generation and transmission companies.”the power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companies.    the power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companies and requested state governments to issue similar directions to state electricity regulators.    the power generation companies are already suffering delays in payments by discoms across the majority of states, with payment due of more than rs 85000 crore as of november 2019 at all india level as per the data on praapti portal.    with covid-19 lockdown accentuating the delays in payments, the availability of adequate liquidity buffer in the form of debt service reserve and undrawn working capital limits remains important from a credit perspective.    however, it said that relief measures such as a moratorium on debt servicing over a 3-month period as notified by reserve bank of india and expected moderation in the interest rate cycle would be a source of comfort in the near term. the timely approval of the moratorium by the boards of the banks and financial institutions remains crucial.    the revenues for power generation companies having long-term power purchase agreements (ppas) with the state distribution utilities (discoms) will be protected by the provision for capacity charges linked to plant availability in case of thermal and large hydropower projects and “must-run” status in case of nuclear and renewable power projects.average monthly thermal plf would further dip to 50-52% against 63% in the corresponding period of the previous year, due to a considerable drop in demand and consequently, power generation companies especially those without any long-term ppas would be adversely impacted given the weakening of the power tariffs in the short-term / power exchange market, said icra ratings sector head & vice president girishkumarkadam.the under-construction renewable power projects as well as epc and manufacturing companies in the solar segment are likely to face execution delays because of disruption in the supply chain in india and labor availability, following the lockdown. given the import dependency on china for sourcing pv modules, the execution timelines for the ongoing solar projects are likely to be affected by delays in the delivery of pv modules following the outbreak of covid 19 in china.    this delay in turn would increase the pre-operative expenses and the overall project cost, which in turn would have an impact on the expected returns.    in this context, the mnre has notified that time extension can be provided for all renewable energy projects, which are impacted by the supply chain disruption due to the covid outbreak, under the force majeure clause.    “given the execution headwinds amid covid 19 affecting q1 of fy2020-21 and assuming the normalcy thereafter, the capacity addition in the wind and solar segments together is likely to degrow by about 25%, thus estimated at about 8 gw against earlier estimates of 11 gw in fy2020-21,” said kadam.

36143.4,"in december 2019, a novel coronavirus strain (sars-cov-2) emerged in the city of wuhan, china. the disease called covid-19 spread to almost every nation in the world creating widespread havoc and disruption in routine life. who recognized it as a pandemic on march 10, 2020. as of april 19, 2020, worldwide around 24 lakh people have been infected and more than 1.6 lakh people have succumbed to covid-19.
 
 
 
 though a vaccine hasn’t been developed yet, the spread of coronavirus can be stopped by washing hands frequently, covering one’s mouth while coughing, and practicing social distancing from other people. countries across the world are using lockdowns as an effective way to stop the spread.
 
 
 
  29 kb of rna has brought the world down to its knees. one-third of the global population has been in lockdown. schools, colleges, businesses, services that are considered non-essential have been put on hold for an indefinite period. even after lifting restrictions, a global recession even worse than the one in 2008 is going to be expected.
 
 
 
 now arriving at the main field of discussion, i.e. hospitality industry. how covid-19 impact hospitality?
 
 
 
 propulsion was building for 2020 to be a year of focal collective action on sustainability. the covid-19 outbreak has emphasized more than ever, the importance of future-proofing business for growth and resilience.
 
 
 
 the hospitality industry includes various services like lodging, food and beverage, events, tourism, transportation, theme parks, etc. before covid – 19 prevailed, we all know that this industry was in much demand and was also one of the major sources of the rising economy. during vacation and festive periods, these were always full of people worldwide. as of now, due to the havoc created and ongoing lockdown they are bearing many losses and is one of the main reason for the decreasing economy.
 
 
 
 have you ever thought of hotels been converted into hospitals, quarantine centers, and isolation centers?  yes, my dear people! amidst this outbreak, many of the hospitality industry properties, be it tiny or enormous have come forward to help the nation fight this life-menacing virus.
 
 
 
 taj hotel in mumbai is attentively aware of its responsibility towards the community and has opened its doors for the major frontline workers, i.e. medical fraternities to stay at their place while they combat the spread of this treacherous virus.
 
 
 
 also, many of the government bodies have been transformed to provide shelter to the homeless. recently, in vadodara – gujarat the building which was built for the employees aiming to work for the major mumbai-ahmedabad bullet train project has been come forward to make it an isolation center for doctors and nurses.
 
 
 
 “railways – the lifeline of citizens.” as railways have started their service years ago, from that period they are being considered as the lifeline of citizens in many metropolitan cities. today at the time of the global pandemic, railways haven’t backed off from the position of the lifeline. yes, my dear friends, you have heard it right! railway coaches in india have been turning into the hospital and isolation centers, marking their presence by helping the government to increase the number of isolation beds. also, many special parcel express trains are running in the entire nation to fulfill the needs of people by transporting essential commodities and goods.
 
 
 
 hospitality has been one of the most innovative industries in the crisis so far. connections have been rapidly formed to donate food and beverages to local charities from various hotels. many of the hospitality bodies are standing in solidarity with the communities affected by this threatening disease by lighting their windows in the shape of a heart, seen in hotels across the world.
 
 
 
 with this outbreak, there is a sharp drop in tourists worldwide as the aviation, railways and public transport buses have come to a standstill due to severe government restrictions.
 
 
 
 today it is clear that hospitality industries must be prepared for various situations like a pandemic, climate change, etc. as of now they are facing devastating and disastrous covid-19 impact on its various sectors.
 
 
 
 the debt being the normal capital intensive component has to be serviced by payment of interest on debt and repayment of debt. hotels being labor-intensive, have lots of fixed costs such as wage bills, besides paying government levies, minimum load charges, etc. the earlier indian hospitality industry was on average witnessing 65 to 70% of occupancy till the end of february. the first few days of march were fine, once things started accelerating, the occupancy has gone down to a severe minimum. also as soon as the pandemic ends by god’s grace, the hospitality industry will still face some loss as the tourists will be much lesser in the beginning months.
 
 
 
 as soon as the crisis gets over, the hospitality industry will have a very crucial role to play in rehabilitating lives within their local communities. millions of people will be unemployed leaving them at high risk of poverty and exploitation. as the industry starts to recover, hospitality will be one of the sources to increase employment to the needy ones taking the poverty level to a minimum.
 
 
 
 within india, after the crisis over, people should travel to the less known and highly economically affected destinations to help the hospitality industry overcome the loss they bore due to covid-19.
 
 
 
 hence, the hospitality industry suffered and is suffering a lot due to this pandemic and despite that, it is also helping the nation to win against this dangerous disease. thus covid-19 impact on hospitality 
 
 
 
 “let’s be grateful to all the frontline workers saving the entire nation and also be thankful to all the various sectors of the hospitality industry who have come forward to help and serve the nation.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 soon we will fight this!
 
 
 stay home! stay safe!

36605.2,"as a race, we are not ready for any kind of crisis. we have fire extinguishers in buildings, but barely any knowledge of how to use it. we convince ourselves that we are prepared but in the face of adversity we stand dumbfounded and give the simplest excuse, that of being in ‘unprecedented times’. the same thing has happened with the coronavirus crisis. if we look back, we can see that this crisis was not avoidable. there was a lot we could have done, but because we underestimated it so much, the situation has now blown out of proportion and cost us thousands of lives, millions of jobs and a massive hit to the world economy. we may be in a unique condition but there is still a lot that we can apply from past experiences and previous calamities. 
 
 
 
 first, let’s look at this in a reflective mode. what are the things we could have done to avoid this crisis in the first place? controlling the origin of a virus is difficult but preventing it from spreading is not. one of the biggest contributors to this unforgiving crisis is the lack of communication or even worse, the propagation of fake news. take india for example. clear communication about the virus was only initiated after a few cases had been identified. we were aware of the hazards of this virus since before and should have acted sooner. the spread of accurate and timely information is a must. if we had spread awareness earlier, we could have controlled the number of cases better, like new zealand and ireland have done. secondly, in a situation of crisis, the first thing to spread is fake news. it is imperative that the government, social media agencies and people themselves act more responsibly. since there is no accurate and transparent information, a lot of uncertainty exists in the society. this impacts the confidence of consumers and investors in the market, which in turn leads to an economic slowdown. past experiences with financial breakdowns and recessions have shown us that retain market trust can only occur with transparency and accuracy of information. organisations should have acted earlier and communicated more effectively with their employees. 
 
 
 
 moreover, we must also understand that specific sectors take the hardest hit during lockdowns. as we have witnessed in earlier lockdowns, curfews, national emergencies and pandemics, the first segment of society to take a hit is the daily wagers and labourers. not only do the prices of goods increase but their income also takes a decline in such a crisis. in such situations, they can’t even afford basic amenities. india witnessed a mass exodus recently, with thousands of people trying to return to their villages on foot. this only leads to more chaos and a decline in containment of the disease. the government should have accounted for such factors before announcing a lockdown with a four hour notice. they could have made better arrangements for food and water in the metro cities itself or giving them safer means to travel home. this is something that they can still include in their relief programs.
 
 
 
 government intervention is a must right now. this can be done in two ways. first, is to create more employment opportunities. governments used this strategy in the sars and ebola virus emergency. health, water, sanitation and hygiene are the most services in the times of health emergencies. intense investment for these services and infrastructure can provide immediate jobs. secondly, if governments use fiscal and monetary policy to fuel demand and maintain current living standards, it can decrease the propensity of a huge fall in economic growth. a fiscal stimulus by the government can make all the difference. having better avenues for cash transfers, easier loans and more exchange will automatically help. a fall in the growth rate is unavoidable as lots of sectors have no choice but to pause all work. however, industries that can provide high returns even now must be encouraged. for example, it sector, health, food and agriculture, etc.
 
 
 
 moreover, governments and businesses should use the most important tool in their hand, the internet! even in the times of physical social distancing, we are still connected to people across the world and are socialising at our normal rates. governments should use these mediums to maintain public spirit, communicate policy strategies and inform people. businesses should use these means to continue working and maintain employee morale. to have balanced crisis management and to prevent panic in the masses, social dialogue and engagement at every level is imperative. use these mediums to educate people about the importance of social distancing, hygiene and steps to be followed.
 
 
 
 all diseases are different and the scientific approach to tackle them varies. however, with most epidemics and pandemics some common steps can be followed. our past experience with fast spreading diseases has shown that the easiest and most effective way to curb it is social distancing. countries have taken impressive steps to ensure social distancing and must keep this up for even a few weeks after curbing the disease. maintaining sanitary habits and hygiene can protect us from infections and increase our immunity. while governments and medical agencies look for ways to tackle the virus at a macro level, we must continue to follow all measures on an individual level too.
 
 
 
 we must also pay a lot of attention to mental and physical well-being now. in the past, when economies took a hit due to the 2008 recession or calamities, the first thing to break was people’s self-esteem. suicide rates, amount of domestic abuse and cases of depression increased manifold. we have to take effort and ensure that we try and live as much of a balanced life as possible. we should stay connected to our friends and not be ashamed of reaching out to others for help. social distancing is not easy and can take a toll on many. lots of special helplines have been set up for the same and people must use them if needed. governments have also given code words for victims of domestic abuse to report crimes in countries like france and spain. we must remember to stay mentally healthy and calm during a crisis as that is the most important thing.
 
 
 
 i don’t believe that every crisis is the same. of course, there are a lot of unique things about the coronavirus pandemic that we had not expected to ever see. even though these are different times, there are still lots of things we can apply from our past experiences. we cannot find a cure for the virus but we can find ways to maintain the economy, our mental peace, and prevent the spread of the virus. the past has a lot to offer if we ponder. we must learn to understand the mistakes of the past and better them in the future. our past experiences with the different crises have taught us that fiscal stimuli work, maintaining employee morale is important and that social. engagement is imperative. if we use these tools efficiently, we can ensure that people only have to fight the virus and not worry about the multitude of repercussions that come with it.",43,47,-0.04444444395061729,0.14492753623188406,6.088235294117647,0.06994943238950176,2.4632738906028595,43.43859751388059,621,2.6441223832528182,4,6.570048309178744
37067.0,"covid-19 an unprecedented pandemic for us but a “can-be” possibility for great leaders such as bill gates came into action since the rising of the year 2020. the corollary of this pandemic is so prodigious that the analysis by the un department of economic and social affairs (desa) stated that the covid-19 pandemic is disrupting global supply chains and international trade which in turn could shrink the global economy by up to 1 percent in 2020, a reversal from the previous forecast of 2.5 percent growth. more than 6.6 million americans filed unemployment claims and the economic downturn is expected to be the worst recession since the great depression as stated by the imf. india is facing its biggest crisis in decades, with a three-week lockdown initially, but extending further in a nation of 1.3 billion people likely to result in an economic recession, millions of job losses and possible starvation among the poor. it can be said that economic contagion is now spreading as fast as the disease itself. on the contrary nature has pressed the reset button, the environment is having a noticeable benefit from this scenario. water is getting clearer, the air is turning breathable and various such news and pictures can be easily heard and seen on newspapers, telly, and social media platforms on day to day basis. but this is the storyline of the present, what about the future? are the predictions made by financial institutions and thought leaders going to be true? or something unexpected is going to happen that will make us think of our human capabilities again?    after this storm of covid-19, it would not be a surprise to see how digitally every business will grow to provide better digital infrastructure and customer experience along with advancement in technology which we are lacking in this present scenario. the touch screens that we are using already will find its vast applications and would be seen in most of the places including hotels, hostels, and shopping malls. all those processes which are interdependent will take an agile turn resulting in better productivity of goods, having a systematic backup giving a better experience to the consumer even in hard situations. the major focus would be making contactless systems hence artificial intelligence and machine learning will become the most rapid and in-demand fields. not only this, but the medical infrastructure and services will also take a boost in the race of developing the systems to handle any situation afterward. the human to machine interaction will increase facilitating fast production, delivery and surveillance inculcating many more. in each and every area the covid will leave its mark may it be retail sector or may it be the banking sector making them modify or fully change their architectures.    even the existing systems would be gifted with some modifications, ensuring them to work in a hard environment even with or without human intervention. the companies will rethink their policies shaping themselves accordingly to manage the resources ensuring safety, agility, and work to be a top priority. the work from home idea will also provide a base for bigger companies ensuring to develop a better infrastructure for their resources and probably giving birth to a new concept of work culture. various existing industries related to either delivery or travel may adopt the new idea of collaboration with other industries which will result in more options for consumers on their old routine apps.        new businesses will root out from the existing ventures resulting in head to head competition in the business world but turning into a brownie point for consumer experience and bandwidth of choices. start-up culture will go hand in hand and expected to take a stupendous growth in the race of providing us a legitimate opportunity to use and feel the real digital world. the various innovations will now take a pace in each field and maybe we will hear some new jargons related to tech in upcoming years. since the global economy has fumbled, countries will now try to take a different turn to vamoose out of this phase. they will try to make new connections by nurturing a give and take relationship and several business relationships would take an unexpected move making the position of several countries sliding up and down on indexes. even rival countries may join their hands in this hard time rather than being dismissed totally under predator countries. it would be surprising to see how these scenarios will be handled by the emperor of minds and how their opponents are going to take it as an agenda for the next elections.    unfortunately, the nature that is at its best will start to face the ill effects after the chart of development and economy will take a pace for exponential growth. it is unfortunate that the inverse relationship between economic growth and environmental destruction exists since carbon emission increases with economic development. as shown by the graph below whenever recession took place the carbon emission decreases along with other harmful gases, turning out as a gift for nature but doom for the financial markets.        but there is a possibility that several start-ups now emerge with the idea of environment conservation collaborating with ngos innovating and using the best of their capability to reduce the ill effect from the present origin point.    in the culmination we can say this pandemic is like “blessing in disguise ” producing a massive impact not only on macro but also on micro-economy. the novel virus not only brought some unexpected results but also uncovered some of our loopholes and unlatched new opportunities for growth, forcing us to define ourselves in several new spheres. quite a while ago we all were chit-chatting about the digital era, how this is benefiting us, covid-19 revealed making us realize this was just the beginning of digital era and a lot is needed to happen in future. it is obvious that not only the indian economy but the global economy is facing and going to face the aftereffects however similar to a virus, the economy will also rise from deep grounds to a green candlestick with individual collaboration!    the businesses will soon rise again, people will get back to their jobs, vendors will start getting profits and everything will fall into its places but now a megalithic competitive environment will rise which will grow till decades until nature again shows it’s color and we as a human abide with its outcomes,

social media, it is easier for businesses to market and advertise their business or the products and services offered by them. it affects both businesses and consumers in a significant manner.    how does marketing influence business?    in the words of peter drucker: “because the purpose of business is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two–and only two–basic functions: marketing and innovation. marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs. marketing is the distinguishing, unique function of the business.”    marketing doesn’t just “impact” a business – it is the function that saves a company from closing down.    marketing has various benefits for business such as –    increasing opportunities    marketing your business can have a huge impact on new

use of correct marketing tools can help businesses in reaching out to more customers, therefore, creating awareness about the product.      strategy formulation    it has a huge impact on the functioning of the business. a business marketing strategy is what you offer, how you offer, and whom you offer. whenever a company forms a marketing strategy they are thinking about the future success of the business. they make sure that they understand consumer needs, and what they want and they know how to communicate well with the target audience so they understand the offer they are

  source- state of marketing, 8th edition, salesforce    this is where conversational marketing can help them reach out to customers effectively and efficiently. it is a powerful way of driving sales and returns on investment (roi). brands using this can have a positive impact on their businesses.    influencer marketing    in no sense, influencer marketing has gained significant attraction in the past one to two years. brands use online influencers for their marketing campaigns through social media platforms like instagram and facebook. it includes influencers creating content by interacting with the product or services offered or with the employee of the business. influencer marketing yields better results than conventional celebrity endorsements. they can easily interact with their followers which results in better engagement. influencer marketing plays a significant role in consumer behavior and psychology such as recommendations. in recent times we have seen various brands like beardo, and muscleblaze use influencers on instagram to market their product. the influencers create content about the product and services offered which creates an online marketing campaign for the businesses.    highly personalized content experience    the content you post can have a significant impact on the development of the business. personalized content can result in better consumer interaction. big businesses like netflix, amazon, spotify, etc. are some successful examples. if we take the example of netflix, it automatically suggests movies and web series on the search history of the user, and the same is done by spotify. facebook makes use of an algorithm that determines the kind of content that should be shown on the user’s feed. amazon makes use of users’ browsing and purchasing history while displaying products when we log in to it. spotify wrapped is one of the music streaming service’s most effective content marketing initiatives. every year, around the new year, spotify subscribers receive a wonderful compilation of all the songs they’ve listened to. the compilation is presented with graphics in vibrant colors and is divided into genres, years, musicians, and more.    users then have the option to share their wrapped playlists on social media, which is a crucial component that has caused the campaign to trend on social media every year since its beginning.       source- https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-01/the-wait-is-over-your-spotify-2021-wrapped-is-here/    adoption of automation    automation in marketing is making use of technology to automate marketing and advertising efforts. the covid-19 pandemic has significantly increased the use of technology and automation not only in marketing but in other sectors of the business as well. it may sound complex but automation in marketing is simple. automated email sequences in sales and the upload of social media posts are all examples of automation in marketing. marketing automation allows businesses to scale their efforts to reach out to larger customers. more than 30% of business owners claim that marketing automation help with time-saving.  their marketing team no longer needs to waste time repetitively focusing on tasks and can focus on optimization and content creation. nissan gathers relevant data about its customers, including the time at which each vehicle was purchased. six months after the automobile is acquired, they can utilize the purchase date to automatically send a reminder email to schedule the first service visit. this is an essential component of nissan’s strategy because maintenance costs collected after the sale of the vehicle make up a significant part of nissan’s overall earnings.       by understanding, consumer behavior marketers can fill in the gap of how consumers buy a product and identify the product that is needed ad the obsolete products.    studying consumer behavior can help marketers to present the product in a way that yields higher consumer attraction. understanding consumer behavior is the key secret to reaching out to more customers for brand recognition, engaging with the clients, and converting those into potential buyers.    how marketing influences consumer decisions?    the primary responsibility of a marketing department is to grow the market share by acquiring and keeping new clients. the best way to do that is by monitoring, evaluating, and controlling consumer behavior. modern marketing strategies easily handle this duty. let’s examine the how and why in more detail.    constant advertising    regularly held marketing initiatives have a significant impact on consumers’ purchase decisions. they pick one brand over another just because they saw the first one’s advertisement more frequently. customers tend to trust some businesses more than others simply because they have better blogs, and more visually appealing material and employ opinion leaders who help customers associate with the company favorably.    emotional connection    instead of informing consumers, modern marketing aims to convince and build strong emotional bonds with brands and products. even if people can’t recall where or when they saw a specific advertisement, they may still experience a specific emotion when they look at a product at a store, such as happiness, comfort, or confidence. it occurs because the advertising they watched caused their brain to detect a particular emotion. the brain immediately connected the product with a certain emotion when they first viewed it. when buyers select from a variety of comparable products from various companies, this relationship will operate flawlessly.       nike advertises in a way that makes its customers comfortable. its tagline, “just do it,” speaks for itself. allowing everybody and everyone to come up with their meaning of the term makes it straightforward but to the point and helps the business build relationships with its customers. the audience is emotionally connected to this slogan.    setting the scene    we believe that each of our social, professional, and informational settings is distinct. but in reality, we all live in a world of marketing where everything is offered for sale and purchased. it’s not good or bad; it’s simply the new commercial reality that dictates what you’ll wear tomorrow, how you’ll address your boss, and how much of your income you’ll spend on eating out. with a few notable exceptions, it is generally applicable to everyone, from a young wealthy nerd who is only 20 years old to a family in their late 30s. if you give it some more thought, you’ll realize that most of the material you encounter each day attempts to sell you something, such as a good, idea, an emotion, a political viewpoint, a way of acting, etc. marketing strategies and tactics in all their forms and guises are what produce this entire environment.     setting trends    take, for instance, the blogs of modern businesses. rather than being sales tools, they appear to be thematic media. companies work to position themselves as the go-to resource for information about a given industry by disseminating their knowledge of it to consumers. in this approach, they produce a ton of content, including viral material that shapes consumer trends and purchasing patterns. today, public perception and reputation are even more valuable than actual goods. if it has a worthwhile message to convey and is effectively promoted, even a plain chicken egg can become viral and break instagram records.       source-instagram    because it informs, equalizes, supports, engages, sells, and expands a business’s operations and offers, marketing is crucial for enterprises. it is equally important in the sense that it greatly influences the potential consumer behavior of the individual. if done correctly marketing can create a huge influence on both businesses and consumers.",72,6,0.8461538353057201,0.08133472367049009,9.401960784313726,0.10346686874280468,3.8021710612226123,99.22472712434968,959,2.8279457768508864,0,7.1689259645464025
38452.4,"perhaps the virtual illusion has become today’s “new reality”.    inquisitive about the conclusion? let’s attempt to vindicate as the outline story unfolds itself.    ever since the concept of gaming floated back in the 1970s a new dimension was put before human beings, intangible in nature, and paradoxically engulfed us since then. it laid an impact on multiple generations in different ways. the last decade witnessed a boom in this industry & with the advancement of technologies in virtual and augmented reality, the gaming world has become an integral part of our day to day experiences. with the intent of being regarded as a leisure activity, it has now percolated over various strata and has managed to gather the attention of teenagers and adolescents on a comprehensive scale.    as we explored the fabric of our engineering batch mates, we came across this peculiar guy holding excellent academics with accolades of his names, seemed to be a nerd at a glance and street smart by nature. concomitance happened to be the reason for experiencing the lifestyle of other personalities that included sam as well.    sam was not only fascinated by the games but used to spend tirelessly hours and hours in front of the white screen engrossed completely leaving the track of time. as our academics advanced, the intensity of involvement in gaming grew deeper and steadily it turned into addiction in no time. we realized the gravity as we were exposed to his change of behavior and shift of priorities due to his unprecedented absence during our lectures and practical. he was modestly reluctant to share about his whereabouts with his peers. the situation turned grim when he wasn’t able to cope up with the subjects and was socially disturbed while interacting. he was compelled towards the fantasy world and was trapped in the vicious cycle of a never-ending backlog of games. as time progressed his performance turned from bad to worse. he was struggling. it was clear as ice that he had something hidden behind that visage.    as sophomores, we were also involved in gaming but soon realized that it does more harm than good. a close cluster of friends decided to lend a helping hand to sam and as they learned about him, the ground beneath their feet slipped away and froze their brain. he had completely lost the circadian rhythm of his sleep, ran into financial losses, aggression draped him, his relations were tarnished due to the habitual routine, and signs of depression were visible on the upfront.    poker was the tartar that he had caught. the game of cards as most of us would perceive it, rather proved to be the fulcrum of sam’s near future. in the quest of pleasure through online games, he entered the tunnel of gambling at a very tender age ignoring the risks involved in terms of financial verticals. he was suffering from internet gaming disorder (igd) & his condition deteriorated as days passed by. apparently, from a healthy individual to a drained skinny one, it took a toll on his physical health. mental disturbance sucked him and he grew insensitive towards his academics. the psychological negative consequences were due to the combination of online gaming and gambling platforms. during that phase, the peer group (gaming group) gained more influence than parental control.     days arrived when he ran short of money and went ahead to ask his friends in college for the funds. since a large amount of money is involved in gambling, a situation exacerbated when sam had his ethical values on the line and breached his boundaries to satisfy his hunger of gaming and leaped towards illegal means to fund his gambling.    the practical project was a crucial part of our engineering curriculum, under which a team of four members was to be established and is expected to remain intact for a year. sam was by no means in anyone’s good books. no one in the batch was ready to risk with sam even though he possessed a brilliant acumen. he was abandoned. we were three friends already and were scouting for the fourth. with mutual consensus, we decided to go ahead with sam. initially, we worked together and collaboration seemed to be perfect. unfortunately, he wasn’t able to clear his backlog exams and had to drop out. at present he plays poker on a professional level, keeping aside his engineering career and battling with his conscience that we may not be aware of.      earlier generations used to spend their time or rather invest their time into activities building up their passion, in some cases they pushed their cognition to such an extreme and contributed to a level that humanity as a whole is in-depth to date. can we imagine our present without the existence of sir edison, sir newton, sir tesla, sir einstein, and many more that were engrossed in their domain and served the necessary impetus for our generation? no one knows that sam could have been our generation scientist, hadn’t he chose that path.      not everyone is sam but perhaps we could miss our einstein or tesla! maybe our newton is waiting for the new upgraded version of the game instead of sitting under the tree. our mendeleev might be involved in arcade games!     feels so numb.      millions of teenagers are involved in online gaming platforms and the community is growing at a rapid rate every year. presently the prevalence of igd among the adolescent group was between 1.3% to 19.9% and males reported more prevalence than females. in the fiscal year 2019, there were 300 million online gamers in india. this number was estimated to go up to 440 million gamers by the fiscal year 2022. overall, india ranked the highest in terms of the growth in online game downloads on app stores with a growth rate of 165 percent between 2016 to 2018. 75% of young people use a mobile phone to play different games, 21% use pc/laptop. games like pubg that promote virtual violence calls for the stern attention of the responsible demographics. as per a study, online games are directly affecting the neurons, leading to chemical imbalance thus causing severe depression and anxiety attacks.      as per the world health organization, depression is interrelated to physical and mental health and the word ‘depression’ that didn’t exist decades back has become prevalent among the youth, leading to more stress and dysfunction and worsening the affected person’s life situation.    anything in excess is poison. so are games.     in deed the virtual illusion has become today’s “new reality”.",30,46,-0.21052631301939062,0.1292517006802721,5.764705882352941,0.05391935413357427,2.327450094594606,31.704580230541673,588,2.61734693877551,2,6.511904761904762

39376.0,"epidemics, in general, have both direct and indirect costs associated with direct and indirect measures adopted to counter (control) the epidemic which generally have both short-run and long-run economic and social consequences. the 2019 coronavirus (covid-19) outbreak globally lead a significant setback to the entire globe. the first case was detected on 26th december 2019 in china.  the world health organization (who) prepared the first diagnostic kit on 14th january 2020.    as the global coronavirus or covid-19 pandemic continues to take hold every economy is feeling it’s effect with a high degree of uncertainty taking a toll in all the manufacturing sectors. supply chain management is an important area with many opportunities for our community to contribute in various forms.  according to the data produced by supply management’s report on business show that pmi (purchasing manager’s index) has declined 1% in the month of february. mainly there has been a huge contraction in the petroleum, transportation and textile industries. although there has been a fall in the inventory but is expected to grow due to supply chain disruptions leading to inefficiencies in material conversion and continued advanced stocking to protect production schedules. a analysis by trading platform forex claimed that heavily 75% of all companies had already reported supply chain disruptions with more than 80% believing that at some point they would experience impacts as a result of covid-19 disruptions. the effective shutdown of industrial activity i.e. china, ground zero for the virus presented particularly difficult problems for manufacturing firms worldwide. imported goods invested by investors set a significant setback.    several experiments were carried out by different governments across the globe to restrict the spread of this pandemic. boris johnson introduced the herd immunity plan in the united kingdom which was a failure followed by a mitigate model which india also tried initially to stop the spread of the covid-19 virus. the last and the ultimate model that most of the countries are applying is the hammer and the dance model i.e. the lockdown model which is estimated to bring down the caseload by 25-30%. the lockdown model basically means buying time to prepare the vaccine to kill the virus.    however, the lockdown has certain critical economic consequences which add to the burden of global distress. this can be explained using the standard macroeconomic keynesian model. the lockdown and the spread of the disease have a direct negative shock on aggregate consumption levels and exports. this leads to a contraction in aggregate demand which leads to a fall in the market rate of interest and aggregate equilibrium output. the secondary effect on the commodity market is via investment demand function which can either increase owing to a fall in the market rate of interest, or fall owing to the contraction in aggregate demand. clearly, the contraction of the aggregate demand-side generates an economic slowdown. on the other hand, restriction of workers gathering in the workplace owing to lockdown hurts the production in those sectors which need the presence of physical workers. note that software or financial service-producing sectors are exempted from such negative supply shock at least in the short-run to medium-run since those works could be easily carried out based on “work from home” anthem. however, reverse migration of workers is an indication of a sharp cut down in production activities. this aggregate supply shock leads to the situation of stagflation. in recent announcements by the reserve bank of india (rbi) to ease liquidity in the system may prove to be counterproductive provided the aggregate supply shock, since the escalation of demand specifically for non-traded products without an adequate increase in production (supply) would only result in inflation. in other words, supply-side management must go hand in hand with demand-side policies. even if policies are undertaken at the national level by the government, however, conditions may not improve much due to shocks in the external sector through trade in commodities. most imports are banned which will increase the economic cost of production of import substitutes within the domestic territory based on the theory of comparative advantage in a ricardian sense. at the same time, exports are hurt due to lower demand from the developed economies. this shows that unemployment and inflation are inevitable in the near future.    corona virus has mainly affected raw material export-driven countries. with the covid-19 virus in the backdrop there will be a decline in new orders, production, and employment with ease in supplier deliveries as demand will be less with a mild decline in the inventories. there has been a huge revenue impact. long stretches of empty supermarket shelves and shortage of essential commodities are only the visible impacts to consumers of the global chain disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic. the uncertainties ahead swing between extremes. as the shortages worsen before they get resolved prices of many commodities could go up for consumers even if laws exist against price gouging. at the same time we should keep in mind that constrained supplies could cause a decline in demand which in turn may end up weakening prices. risk management process is not robust enough to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. the seemingly relentless forces of globalization and technology with coronavirus in the backdrop will present us with new supply chain challenges and opportunities for further progress in the near future. there is a glimmer of good news as countries globally haven taken preventive measures but the recovery may be fragile.    the crisis due to the global pandemic is likely to be more serious for developing economies compared to the global financial crisis of 2008. this is due to the fact that the global financial crisis leads to lower demand for exports from the developing economies by the developed nations which further lead to contraction of export-based industries and other sectors in the developing nations due to inter-sectoral backward and forward linkage effect, however, the burden of retrenchments in the formal sector was absorbed in the informal sector. in the present situation, the problem of vanishing informal sector is evident since informal sector workers are more vulnerable to the spread of the disease due to the absence of non-regulatory authority and out of direct government control. moreover, lockdown lead to massive close down of this informal units, thus the informal sector in this present set up is vanishing due to which the shock absorption capacity of developing economy like india is becoming weaker. the global economy is drowning towards deep cycles

39837.8,"covid 19 has bought the world to its knees. with businesses being shut, travel being banned, schools, and colleges being closed, we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction. though situations are improving now, and the lockdowns are being lifted, it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people, and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentally.    we’ve been reading articles regarding the impact of covid 19 on the economy, education, mental health, and every other possible aspect. but one topic which has not been talked about much is the impact of covid 19 on office space and co-working industries. well, it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now, but, the covid period hasn’t ended. this means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices; where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space. the same will be the condition in co-working industries, wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roof.    however, these problems are quite obvious (though people haven’t thought about them much), but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters; but it also extends to metal space, or for that fact, space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinions.    coronavirus has left a big scratch in our country; just the way a car needs repair after an accident, our country will also need repair after the control of this virus. but, unlike a car, our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any support.    needless to say, the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason. but the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce, it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees. while some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly, others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salary.    people tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition. the problem doesn’t arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other, but instead, it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others. and in today’s world, where people keep money at the top of their priority list, comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their company.    since there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies, there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company; who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary. this may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better, but however, will bring huge losses in the long run. the fact is; employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their boss’s eyes.    moreover, since there will be comparisons among the employees, it might happen that the ‘employee of the month’ ends up being hated by all other employees in the company. another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending; wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they don’t. this might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around, and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office. in fact, employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities; which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their best.    such situations will definitely arise in companies and offices; wherein employees will compete for attention and resources; which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning. and all this will happen because of only one thing; lack of office mental space i.e. space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork, along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some time.    another kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the long-lasting impact of covid 19 is the co-working industry and offices. this is because, there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people, but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure, as well the rent will remain the same. because of this, employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest; to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used. however, the number of resources will be the same, and so, there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same.    if the above two situations happen to occur at the same time (which they most likely will), we will observe a scene of intra-company as well as inter-company competition. also, our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition; which itself will be a result of limited mental space.    covid 19 will have severe impacts on the office (mental) space of companies and people.  people’s thoughts, how they treat others, along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyone’s lives. moreover, we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists; because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment. however, we need to cope with this thing and realize that it is indeed very important for us to start preparing to expand our mental space and that this competition and comparison will not stay for long and should not affect our personal relations and life at any cost.",32,35,-0.044776118734684796,0.12959381044487428,5.068627450980392,0.03788927587764678,2.0426066907432157,19.588755628743385,517,2.611218568665377,1,6.413926499032882

iran.    major sporting events, carnivals and events have been postponed or cancelled.    the covid-19 coronavirus has now spread to every continent except antarctica, challenging health systems and governments everywhere. although the vast majority of the almost 90,000 cases around the world are in china where the virus originated, 64 different countries* are now affected.    for most, the virus represents a mild health issue, but for vulnerable members of society the consequences can be more serious. containment remains a priority for all countries but there is no one-size-fits-all approach to tackling the spread of the disease.    france    the french government has advised its citizens to abandon the customary “bise” greeting – involving kissing each other on the cheek – in a bid to slow the spread of covid-19.    public gatherings of more than 5,000 people are also off limits, resulting in the cancellation of events like the paris half marathon. following the decision, the

42608.6,"while coronavirus has affected the life of every individual, it has also affected various industries for better or for worse. while certain industries like pharma, mobile and web-streaming industries, fitness and teleconference apps have boomed during this pandemic, industries like tourism, fast-food industry, retail and leisure sectors have suffered the worst hit due to coronavirus impact
 
 
 
 during this lockdown to prevent the spreading of coronavirus impact, almost all of the companies have adopted a work-from-home culture and have used various teleconference apps to hold meetings. teleconference apps are also being used by college institutions and universities so that the studies don’t get disrupted. also, confined to their homes, people have started engaging more in fitness apps, and web streaming services like netflix, youtube, and amazon prime are at their zenith.
 
 
 
 while these industries are thriving in this pandemic, the most affected industry during this time is the hospitality industry.
 
 
 
 hospitality industry embodies various sectors like transportation, traveling, airlines, hotels, and lodges, etc. hotels and traveling are also a major part of the tourism industry. the tourism and hospitality industries may appear somewhat similar, but they have their subtle distinctions. tourism mainly involves traveling and services to those who are away from home. the hospitality industry involves businesses and services that are concerned with leisure and enjoyment and mainly run on customer experience and satisfaction. their customers may also be local inhabitants along with tourists.
 
 
 
 the hospitality industry can be majorly divided into accommodations, travelling, and food and drinks. 
 
 
 
 accommodations include hotels, resorts, hostels, motels, etc. the best of the hotels and resorts that were basking at their peeks, now have no option but to lay off their employees. many hotels are down to zero occupancies and have led to an immense loss for the hotel establishments. the same is the case for resorts, hostels, motels, etc. that provide accommodations. since there are no occupants, there is no money inflow, which is leading to the layoffs of employees as the owners are not able to provide paychecks anymore.
 
 
 
 businesses in the accommodation sector that have just started, are finding it difficult to cope up with this situation. various governments have extended small business bridge loans to cope up with this situation. the accommodations sector has no other way to cope with this situation but to wait for the situation to improve so that they can improve their business.
 
 
 
 traveling restrictions are imposed by various governments to avoid the spreading of coronavirus. travel agencies, car rentals, tour operators, flights, and airlines have been hit quite severely by covid-19. due to the fear of spreading coronavirus, people have limited their public outings or have stopped stepping out altogether unless to shop for daily essentials. coronavirus impact on travel that ban lays out restrictions on who can travel from where to where. many international and domestic flights have been suspended to tackle the coronavirus crisis. havoc is created across the aviation industry.
 
 
 
 the months from march to may are said to be the busiest times of the year for the tours and travel industry. but people are reluctant to travel in the fear of catching coronavirus or getting stuck abroad if the governments announce restrictions, thereby overstaying their visas that can imply their future travels abroad. airlines and tourism agencies have stopped marketing and advertising as it would be irresponsible and does not make sense during this crisis.
 
 
 
 to cope up with this situation, airlines like virgin atlantic and american airlines have started deploying passenger flights to carry cargo, while various airlines have laid off. commercial travel has dropped tremendously. also, there is a recent drop in jet fuel prices. it is being estimated that many airlines are going to go bankrupt if this situation persists.
 
 
 
 apart from airlines, the cruise industry and travel agencies also take a toll this year. they are facing cancellations of bookings, and some new travel agencies are at a risk of closing down rendering all their employees either losing their jobs or going on unpaid leaves in this time of crisis.
 
 
 
 it is predicted that once the pandemic is over or the situation is under control, the travel and tour industry can take about 10 months to return to normalcy. however, this outbreak may affect the entire tourism industry’s future.
 
 
 
 many foods and drinks services fall under the hospitality industry as they offer people services that provide them leisure time. their customers not only include tourists but locals, passerby’s, etc. these mainly include restaurants, tea and coffee shops, bars and pubs, catering, etc.
 
 
 
 catering is provided at places mainly where there is a social gathering, to deliver food and drinks services where it is not provided or not according to the organizer’s preference. due to this pandemic, many countries are in lockdown, and even those that are not in lockdown are not allowed to hold public gatherings as a safety precaution. due to the avoidance of public gatherings and events to maintain social distancing, catering services are halted for now.
 
 
 
 restaurants, tea and coffee shops, pubs, and bars have all closed down not only for the safety of their customers but also keeping in mind the safety of their employees and workers. however, a few restaurants that offer food delivery are still working, by taking all the necessary health and sanitation precautions to prevent the spreading of coronavirus. the number of such restaurants seems to be declining with the increasing cases of covid-19 as the customers are becoming more and more afraid and cautious about the situation. though, quick-service food deliveries can cope better than the full-service restaurants during this crisis.
 
 
 
 because of this unprecedented crisis, all these industries that are being affected are hoping for government support to make it through such tough times. without some financial support or help from the government or other institutions, it will be difficult for various establishments to survive through this crisis.
 
 
 
 it is being indicated that the world will face the worst recession since the great depression during this pandemic with so many people losing their jobs, especially those working in the hospitality industry. thus coronavirus impact on different industries",24,33,-0.1578947340720222,0.10106382978723404,5.529411764705882,0.07869311143818947,2.243241950457629,44.38291485113886,564,2.7854609929078014,0,6.957446808510638
432.0,"“more gains on quality, affordability and accessibility are on the way”    what do tele-med means?    as the world evolves and advances, so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives. one of that advancement is telemedicine. it’s not an overnight change, but more like how summer turns into fall – gradual yet very perceptible. we are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. how will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040? i believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. but first of all, what is telemedicine? it is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another.    role of tele-med during a pandemic    telemedicine’s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. the ubiquitous smartphone, capable of video interactions, can be a lifeline for underserved populations. in rural areas with few mental health professionals, for example, intermountain’s’s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. early in the covid-19 pandemic, telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. when the pandemic forced the closure of in-person clinics and offices, psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in-person visits.    advantages of telemed in today’s era    patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two-pronged nightmare. there’s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. patients may bounce from one local physician to the next, wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. telemedicine offers a far better solution. virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. by eliminating the barriers of time and distance, telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. the first is misdiagnosis. the second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan.    rise of the telemedicine industry post-pandemic    source: the indian express    this step-change, borne out of necessity, was enabled by these factors: 1) increased consumer willingness to use telehealth, 2) increased provider willingness to use telehealth, and 3) regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. during the tragedy of the pandemic, telehealth offered a bridge to care, and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in-person care models, with a goal of improved healthcare access, outcomes, and affordability.    our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs, but—as expected—this view varies widely depending on the type of care. overall, consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties (exhibit 2).    around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward—up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before covid-19.    its impact on human beings over the years    moreover, our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions, such as a “digital front door” or lower-cost virtual-first health plan.6 however, a gap has historically existed between consumers’ expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface, breaking down silos in care provision (across virtual and in-person) with improved data integration and insights, and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes.    increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform indian health, improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends, those with chronic and mental health issues, and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. it could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. as of july 2021, we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial covid-19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. the findings include the following insights:    “ telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38x higher than before the pandemic. similarly, consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre-covid-19 era. investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed, fuelling further innovation. virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating.”    access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. despite the challenges ahead, substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic.    is the rise in tele-med industry temporary or will keep growing?    the trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. in some areas, such as urgent care and specialty care, patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. moving forward, there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike.    role of business leaders in achieving new model    when creating a new model of health care, the hard work is in the details, and because a tele-driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery, developing one entails thousands of decisions. medical and financial leaders will need to design, shape, and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. the specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article, but here are two major considerations: reimbursement and care delivery requisites.    businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. they should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. even before covid-19 struck, sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals, experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5% annually. businesses can expect extremely high medical-cost inflation if nothing is done. the time to act is now.    summing it up    lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable

4321.0,"“more gains on quality, affordability and accessibility are on the way”    what do tele-med means?    as the world evolves and advances, so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives. one of that advancement is telemedicine. it’s not an overnight change, but more like how summer turns into fall – gradual yet very perceptible. we are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. how will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040? i believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. but first of all, what is telemedicine? it is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another.    role of tele-med during a pandemic    telemedicine’s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. the ubiquitous smartphone, capable of video interactions, can be a lifeline for underserved populations. in rural areas with few mental health professionals, for example, intermountain’s’s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. early in the covid-19 pandemic, telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. when the pandemic forced the closure of in-person clinics and offices, psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in-person visits.    advantages of telemed in today’s era    patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two-pronged nightmare. there’s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. patients may bounce from one local physician to the next, wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. telemedicine offers a far better solution. virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. by eliminating the barriers of time and distance, telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. the first is misdiagnosis. the second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan.    rise of the telemedicine industry post-pandemic    source: the indian express    this step-change, borne out of necessity, was enabled by these factors: 1) increased consumer willingness to use telehealth, 2) increased provider willingness to use telehealth, and 3) regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. during the tragedy of the pandemic, telehealth offered a bridge to care, and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in-person care models, with a goal of improved healthcare access, outcomes, and affordability.    our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs, but—as expected—this view varies widely depending on the type of care. overall, consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties (exhibit 2).    around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward—up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before covid-19.    its impact on human beings over the years    moreover, our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions, such as a “digital front door” or lower-cost virtual-first health plan.6 however, a gap has historically existed between consumers’ expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface, breaking down silos in care provision (across virtual and in-person) with improved data integration and insights, and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes.    increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform indian health, improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends, those with chronic and mental health issues, and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. it could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. as of july 2021, we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial covid-19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. the findings include the following insights:    “ telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38x higher than before the pandemic. similarly, consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre-covid-19 era. investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed, fuelling further innovation. virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating.”    access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. despite the challenges ahead, substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic.    is the rise in tele-med industry temporary or will keep growing?    the trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. in some areas, such as urgent care and specialty care, patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. moving forward, there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike.    role of business leaders in achieving new model    when creating a new model of health care, the hard work is in the details, and because a tele-driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery, developing one entails thousands of decisions. medical and financial leaders will need to design, shape, and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. the specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article, but here are two major considerations: reimbursement and care delivery requisites.    businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. they should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. even before covid-19 struck, sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals, experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5% annually. businesses can expect extremely high medical-cost inflation if nothing is done. the time to act is now.    summing it up    lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. the pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. done well, the transition to a tele-driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. if left to chance, it could take decades—if it happens at all. the current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system.

43532.2,"the hospitality sector in india has witnessed unprecedented deceleration this year in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic. the indian hotel sector has been hit hard, tussling with significantly low demand, with very few future bookings. since the outbreak of covid-19, companies have been canceling interviews at the top hotel management colleges in india. the overall hiring sentiment in the country is witnessing a negative impact in the short term with 60-65 percent of interviews getting postponed, especially in the hospitality services sector, following the slowdown across industries triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. even the students who were aspiring for a career in the hospitality industry are on the verge of full swing. currently, with the imposition of section 144, there are barely any bookings being made for the future, and the current ones all stand canceled. in this scenario, there is limited scope for quick revival.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 it’s proud to see that this sector shows its maturity level: in working together, showing their true hospitality commitments in helping out our society where they can. for example by making their venue available for hospital beds and hospital employees. the situation we are in also brings new business models and opportunities, in defining, for instance, new delivery concepts, human capital sharing platforms, initiatives in promoting the “staycation or holiday concept” and the use of the less productive time to work on activities that were normally pushed forward like asset counts, security plans, defining standard operating procedures, social media plans, etc.
 
 
 
 what has caused the panic?
 
 
 
 this may seem obvious, but it’s worth looking at this a bit closer. the main reason there was such widespread panic was that the government announced its advice to avoid public meeting places like restaurants, bars, and pubs without simultaneously announcing a complete ban or a plan to support the businesses whose revenue streams they’d just denied. many of these businesses operate on low margins and very fragile cash flow already so the prospect of survival for an indefinite period of time without income seemed very bleak indeed. this has taken a mental toll on already stressed business owners and their worried staff.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 facts & figures – coronavirus effect on the hospitality:
 
 
 
 the impact of the novel coronavirus on india’s hospitality sector jobs is nothing short of severe. while most economists expect things to rebound in the latter half of the year, uncertainty still lurks. a sheer job trauma is staring at the hospitality industry in the near future. this is as the chances of losing a job are at high risk. furthermore the entry-level has postponed the hiring for the near future. let us check here some of the facts concerning the drop in the various hotel occupancy sectors.
 
 
 
 
 the country’s daily hotel occupancy dropped to 11% during 23-29 march, according to preliminary data from str, department of revenue, ministry of finance, government of india due to covid-19 concerns, and limitations that have intensified in india.
 along with a steep downward trend in occupancy, the average daily rate (adr), and revenue per available room (revpar) have also dropped significantly in india. adr, which has dropped year over year by around 20% or more for eight consecutive days, went as low as inr4, 924.18 on 28 march. revpar attained its least absolute level (inr537.54) on 22 march.
 in india, both luxury and budget hotels are running at just 10 percent of occupancy levels as thousands of people have canceled their trips. this may further worsen in the times to come at least till the end of this year. for instance, airbnb announced its guests could cancel their reservations for a full refund.
 the overall revenue of the indian hotel sector is set to decline by anywhere between us$ 8.85 billion to us$ 10 billion, reflecting an erosion of 39% to 45% compared to last year.
 besides the actual business loss, the hotel owners will also incur losses due to fixed operating expenses, debt repayments, interest payments, and several other compliances required to be undertaken as part of the sector.
 with hospitality and travel sectors among the worst affected by covid-19, oyo’s entire executive leadership (cxos) team has taken a voluntary pay cut, starting at 25%, with many opting for a supplementary untapped amount, and some going up to 50% to enable constructing the runway for the company.
 ritesh agarwal, the founder & group ceo, oyo hotels & homes, has decided to forego 100% of his salary for the rest of the year in the wake of the novel coronavirus crisis.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 proposed action plans -coronavirus effect on the hospitality
 
 
 
 the hospitality industry can use this chasm to prepare for the upcoming demand by focusing on marketing and up-gradation. this ‘stop gap plan’ is about maintaining a thread of communication, using social media and advertisements, with the consumers. it’s also about strengthening the communication within the company, making a budget and plan for re-opening, and utilizing this period to fix and upgrade whatever is possible. another step is where all the action is required by the sector. once the outbreak of the virus is contained and the world is set to travel again, it is suggested that any plan of re-opening must be done keeping long-term benefits and safety compliances in mind. it is imperative that hospitality companies reach out to deferred and canceled bookings and give due attention to domestic travelers. the hotels and airlines must slowly roll out their services rather than starting everything instantly and not get caught up in spending.this way coronavirus effect on the hospitality
 
 
 
 a way forward: recommendations for the government of india
 
 
 
 the government is already taking measures to combat the effects of the pandemic on the country. here are the multiple measures, if taken by the government of india, can help the indian hotel industry weather the current storm.
 
 
 
 
 stimulus package to stabilize and support the hospitality sector in the near term, including a workforce support fund to ensure that there are no job losses.
 provide a moratorium of ~ 6 – 12 months on all loans (principal & interest), including working capital payments and overdrafts.
 ensure that credit rating agencies do not downgrade ratings of businesses, due to the expected volatility of the business in the short to medium term.
 provide a 12-month corporate tax holiday to travel, tourism, and hospitality sectors.
 defer all statutory dues such as advance tax, custom duties, excise duties, pf, bank charges, etc. at the central and state level for 12 months.
 the government authorities must ensure that there is adequate availability of collateral-free and interest-free credit for organizations in the hospitality, travel, and tourism industries.
 
 
 
 
 what will coronavirus leave behind?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 really this is anyone’s guess. we don’t yet know how long it will take for the epidemic to peak and for us to be allowed out again, but one thing i am sure of is that we’ll all be desperate to meet up with friends over dinner or have a pint in the pub! with proper support from the government i think the hospitality industry stands a good chance of bouncing back quickly, but perhaps not in its former form. it is likely that we will see a kind of natural selection take place among restaurants, leaving space for innovative new entrants. the crisis has already forced several restaurants to innovate by developing new services and perhaps, if regulation allows, these will stick, becoming new models for restaurants in the future and offering them a more diverse and resilient set of revenue streams. thus coronavirus effect on the hospitality and other sectors.",30,36,-0.09090908953168046,0.09166666666666666,7.0588235294117645,0.08306495096253334,2.856755392149719,59.80676469302401,720,2.629166666666667,4,6.606944444444444
43994.0,"“stay at home”, “crisis”, “pandemic”, “covid-19”    these are just a few terms that come to mind when you wake up every morning and listen to the world mourning. with the coronavirus pandemic hitting almost 210 countries throughout the globe and having no possible cure for the foreseeable future, the state of the world is as dismal as it can ever get. the “great lockdown” as it is being called is having adverse effects on almost everything a common man does but more importantly having a grave impact on the world of work. in this article, let’s look at what is the current status of the working population throughout the world and what lies ahead in the future.    2020 marked the beginning of a new decade and a seemingly difficult one for various organizations across the world. the first quarter of 2020 brought with it, major issues for the workforce. the implementation of lockdowns in various countries such as india, germany, italy, china, the uk, etc. has made “work from home” a compulsion for everyone except those working for essential goods and services companies. the crisis has already led to a worldwide economic slowdown and a period of recession is looming on our heads. the international monetary fund (imf) has predicted a shrink of 3% in the global gdp indicating the extent of the crisis. the severity of the issue is being felt by various big companies in india and other major powers of the world. in an interview, anand mahindra, ceo of m&m group said that the manufacturing and production sector has been hit the hardest with the lack of labor force. he mentioned the lack of wage workers who help in loading and unloading of material is making transport a major issue for his company, also hinting at the importance of these small workers on the macro-level. ceos and managers of various organizations are having a hard time dealing with this crisis. with almost all mncs such as pwc, bcg, deloitte, ibm, infosys, etc. making “work from home” compulsory till around mid-may’20, the importance of technology is at its peak now. whether it’s conducting meetings over zoom or conference calls over duo, staying at home and working is becoming normal as we move forward. service-based companies are finding it easier to complete their tasks as compared to product-based companies. according to the imf the world is going to lose usd 9 trillion in output in 2020 which is more than the combined output of both germany and japan.    the manufacturing sector is one of the worst-hit by the pandemic. china, the world’s largest exporter of goods and the epicenter of the covid-19 pandemic has seen a significant fall in output in the first two months of 2020. chinese industrial production has fallen by 13.5% and major manufacturers in china are facing problems relating to the shutdown and lack of workforce. restrictions have affected the supply of chinese companies like jcb, saic, nissan to name a few. organizations such as samsung, kia, hyundai, and all other non-essential goods companies have been forced to shut down factories to comply with lockdown norms and for the safety of their employees. indian manufacturing giants such as bajaj and tata have taken the toll due to the lockdown measures in india. bajaj has been forced to cut employee salaries by 30% and worker salaries by 10% due to a lack of revenue. us-based smartphone and tech giant apple inc. has shut all its stores worldwide with its factories in china and the usa unable to produce new products for the time being. these are just a few examples and production has been hit globally in all countries and there is a lack of demand to compliment this, further enhancing the problem faced by producers.        the world of work also includes those who are willing and able to work but cannot find a job, i.e., the unemployed. the unemployment rate is at a staggering high across all nations affected by the pandemic. according to the us bureau of labor statistics, the number of people filing for unemployment hit a record high close to 7 million people. china reported an unemployment rate of 6.2% in jan’20 and figures are expected to get worse in many other countries. according to the international labor organization, more than 25 million workers may go jobless soon due to this crisis and lead to a significant decline in income. the financial crisis of 2008 caused a 22 million spike in unemployment worldwide and the nature of the current situation makes it more dangerous. the fall in revenues and effects on both supply as well as demand mean that companies are having a hard time maintaining their balance sheet and taking care of their liabilities. lack of job opportunities from the next quarter and salary cuts for existing employees might be the way forward in the corporate world.        amongst all the negative impacts of covid-19 on organizations across the globe, there are a few opportunities that are ready to be explored after this crisis. technology and artificial intelligence are key aspects that have been mentioned in the past to be the ones contributing to the growth and a rise in revenues for various businesses. in times of social distancing and a shutdown of physical services, the digital markets may prove to be game-changers in the near future. offering products online and promoting through digital marketing will be at the forefront. the quarantine time must be utilized in order to improve existing products and increase the customer base of companies. byju’s, india’s famous online learning platform is leading by example in this front by offering its application essentials and courses for free. this will help them expand their brand in the coming years and create a customer base. cult fit, a bangalore based fitness startup has used technology to create an application helping fitness freaks to workout from home. oneplus, the chinese smartphone brand launched its new flagship, the oneplus 8 in an online event, and created a filter to let smartphone lovers do a virtual unboxing of the device as getting the device physically is not possible at the moment due to restrictions. decathlon, america’s leading sports and fitness equipment brand started an online campaign, “we’re in this together” and the hashtag “#playitsafe” to appeal to their customers and increase sales of their home workout equipment. these examples show how brands and organizations have realized the importance of this lockdown to expand their base and consolidate their position in the market as they battle out the crisis.    the covid-19 pandemic has led to chaos and panic throughout the working world. but there are huge opportunities for companies to expand and improve in the future. all organizations need to have a designed plan in place to ensure smooth functioning once the lockdown is lifted. social distancing and hygiene will become key for manufacturing industries. the travel industry which is currently in its worst state will need to recover fast in order to ensure the safe movement of passengers once borders are reopened across the world. the service sector will need to move to digital platforms and hype digital marketing. artificial intelligence will play a key role with a reduction in workforce eminent due to lack of demand. handling tasks with the help of ai and reducing the need for an employee will improve cost-effectiveness until revenues rise back to normal. e-learning has evolved over the past few years and its importance has been realized over this quarantine period. all major colleges and schools have transformed into an online program in order to educate students. this change is likely to be carried forward with more and more educational institutes switching platforms. e-commerce has also been an integral part of the world and will become even more important in the coming days. as malls and markets are shut and are expected to remain shut, e-commerce websites will benefit from the same. it is also an opportunity for retailers and vendors to create their base online or sell through e-retailers in order to generate revenue. small vendors and retailers will continue to be an important part of the supply of the essential good to households and improving sanitation in these places will be key. mncs that have switched to the atmosphere of “work from home” will find it easier to connect large groups of people together at all times and ensure all employees contribute to the smooth functioning of the companies in the crucial days up ahead. entrepreneurial minds will also be encouraged to put forth their idea and create a startup of their own to make the corporate world an improved space in the future.    the world is in a state of panic and it is important for all of us to be united in this fight against covid-19. as employees continue to work from home and make study rooms their cabins, organizations need to adapt to this new style of working and realize its importance for the coming months until a solution is found for this problem. internet and online services will play an important role in the future. this transition will lead to a better “digital world” and improve accessibility throughout the globe.    stay safe, stay together and develop your company

44455.8,"“if anything kills over 10 million people over the next few decades, it’s most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war” – bill gates    bill gates in his tedx address in 2015 pointed out to the predicament of world leaders who failed to invest sufficiently into health infrastructure and he further elaborated on the inability of the prevailing health facilities to accommodate the next pandemic the world would face.    the whole world is grappling with covid-19- the virus that took birth in the city of wuhan and spread across the globe, claiming more than half a hundred thousand lives and affecting more than two million people.    with the fear of the virus spreading, the whole world entered into a complete and stringent lockdown mandated by the national governments. this caused economic activities worldwide to come to a standstill except for sectors that provisioned essential goods and services. the international agency-imf has projected that the global output will contract by 3% in 2020 which is even worse than the 2008-09 financial crises. moody downgraded the global growth forecast to 2.5% in 2020 from an earlier estimate of 5.3%. the us economy is expected to contract by 2%, euro-era by 2.2% and china is expected to grow at 3.3% rather than an earlier estimate of 6% in 2021    the national governments have been presented with inevitable challenges of ensuring sustenance and livelihood to masses, improving investor confidence and preventing the economies from falling into a recession in the absence of consumerism amidst the uncertainty about the longevity and future intensity of the pandemic.    the goi took the decision to enter into lockdown in the preliminary phase of the spread of the virus. the indian economy in the fiscal year 2019 was already hit by severe npa crises. it witnessed a downward spiral and grew at a mere rate of 5% as against 6.8 % in 2018 as per the statistics released by the nso-national statistical organization. the manufacturing and construction sectors were negative outliers. the government in order to recuperate announced a plethora of decisions. the government cut the corporate tax from 30% to 22% and for manufacturing enterprises from 25% to 15%. in order to strengthen the position of public sector banks, the government announced the merger of 10 public sector banks into 4    the government also announced a fiscal stimulus of 1.7 lakh crores inr stepping over its fiscal deficit target in order to drive the economy out of the downward spiral and get it on the path of growth, giving lubricant to an economy facing liquidity crunch with heightening npa.    but the coronavirus outbreak halted the economic activity and posed government the issue of fulfilling the basic survival needs of workers in the informal sector in the wake of massive urbanization. the daily wage earners tried to walk down to their native places in huge numbers posing immense difficulty for the government. apart from that the domestic equity market indices- the bse sensex and nse nifty crashed which reflected the erosion of investor confidence and reflected stealth of bearish sentiment around the world.    all this amalgamated together posed a serious question on the survival of a huge chunk of the indian population and invited a lot of criticism for the government.    this is when the central nda government announced a fiscal relief package: the central government announced a fiscal stimulus of additional inr 1.7 lakh crores that constitutes approximately 0.8% of india’s gdp under pradhan mantri gareeb kalyan yojna. this fiscal stimulus is used to target the underprivileged section of the society instead of conventional indirectly lubricating the economy through deficit financing.    the government under the nfsa-national food security act has decided to provide an additional 5 kg of indian staple wheat and rice and 1 kg of pulses every month to people with ration cards. the government is expanding and accelerating the dissemination of unilateral transfers under various government schemes.  under pm kisan scheme an indian farmer receives payment of inr 6000 in three installments every year. out of 6000 the goi had disbursed inr 2000 immediately. the government has made a provision of providing 2 installments inr 1000 for the next three months those already availing old ages, women, or disability pension. the women who are jan dhan account holders are to receive inr 500 for the next three months. the government assured the availability of cooking gas by providing 1 lpg cylinder for the next three months to 8.3 crores people covered under ujjwal yojna.  the government in order to prevent the deterioration of and encourage entrepreneurial spirit in already discriminated rural women the government made a provision for women shg’s where they can receive collateral-free loans up to inr 20 lakhs under nrlm (national rural livelihood mission). the government also enhanced payment under mgnrega from inr 180/day to inr 202/day.    the government has also taken upon itself to provide for the epf contributions of 12% each of the basic salaries of both employees and employers for the next three months. in order to ensure household liquidity the employees can withdraw from their epf accounts balance up to 75%. the goi is also providing insurance coverage if inr 50 lakh for a tenure of 3 months for about 22 lakh health workers in government hospitals inclusive of asha workers, medical, sanitary workers, and paramedics.    the finance minister nirmala sitaraman also pointed out that increased money supply combined with the dollar swap with the usa will help curb the inflammatory effect also.    shaktikanta das, the rbi chief announced a monetary relief package for the economy that seemed to regain investor confidence as the national stock indices rallied. the following are the elements of the package:    the repo rate is the rate at which the commercial banks can avail loans from rbi. the rbi cut repo rate by 75 basis points from 5.15% to 4.4%. this reduction in the cost of borrowing from rbi gives commercial banks an incentive to enjoy increased margins by borrowing at a relatively lower rate than past and investing at the same rate i.e. by granting loans to businesses and households.cut in reverse-repo rate by 25 basis points from 4% to 3.5%. the reverse repo rate is the rate at which banks can park their funds with the rbi. this primarily implies the reduction in the interest rate the banks can earn by parking their funds with the rbi. this incentivizes them to lend. but given the commercial bank’s acquaintance with the friction caused by erosion of consumerism due to fear of covid-19; it is hard to forecast how successful the aforementioned steps are.    the rbi also announced a moratorium or a provision to defer payments of emi’s on home, car, and credit card dues for a period of 3 months from 1st march-31st may. the government also provided for interest-free loans for the msme sector to meet their working capital requirements after the lockdown has been uplifted.the rbi also announced a refinancing window for inr 50,000 crores for financial institutions like nabard, national housing bank, and sidbi.    as the markets crashed the foreign institutional investors withdrew their investments from the indian market, increasing the demand for usd and increasing the supply of inr causing the rupee to depreciate. the currency hit the bottom low of inr 76/ usd.  to prevent further erosion in the value of rupee the rbi entered into a 6-month swap agreement with the us government. the deliberation to undertake a currency swap began when as a result of panic-selling the foreign exchange reserves fell around $7.5 billion in two weeks to $439.66 billion on march 27.    despite tourism, hospitality, domestic trade, airline industry taking a hit, india was presented with quite a few opportunities as well.    india came as a messiah to export hydroxychloroquine to the usa, followed by indian pharmacy companies- lupin, dr. reddy’s laboratories, strides pharma’s plants in india, and biocon’s plant in malaysia being given clearance by us fda-us food and drug administration. this gives massive export opportunities to these entities, improving their growth prospectus. the crash of crude oil prices caused by falling out of negotiations between opec and russia creating supply pressure along with lowered demand enabled india to lower its import bill. according to a report by icra every $10 decline in crude oil price saved india $15 billion.    not only india but countries like the usa, japan, uk, and germany have announced massive fiscal stimulus packages to equip their economies to come out of this phase of decelerating economic activity.    us announced a fiscal package of $2 trillion with is approximately 9.3% of its gdp. this relief package is the largest relative to the gdp is the largest of the kind in the modern american history. it is way larger than $800 billion assistance provided in 2008. germany introduced largest fiscal stimulus in relation to gdp.    the following graph indicates the fiscal stimulus as a proportion of gdp of respective countries        workers in the us whose annual incomes are up to $75000 will receive $1200 in direct payments as well as $500 for every offspring. america being america came to the rescue of businesses by allocating $500 billion to businesses and local government bodies.    it announced various sectorial packages-$50 billion for passenger airlines, $8 billion for cargo carriers, $17 billion for businesses involved in maintaining national security. taking care of the small industry sector, the us government committed itself to devote $350 billion to the working capital requirements of these entities. the government further allocated $150 billion for the health care sector, $45 billion for the disaster relief fund, $31 billion for the education sector, $27 billion for research and development, and $15.5 billion towards the food stamp program.        . republican president donald trump has been under a lot of criticism lately. the tackling of the covid-19 crises by america could either relinquish trump administration or them another tenure. but so far the situation seems critical with the usa registered with the maximum number of cases    china- the epicenter of the pandemic has been facing a lot of backlash from world powers like the usa, uk, france, and germany; each country asking for monetary compensation. the us even alleged that china has conducted low-frequency nuclear tests while the whole world is anguished. china has also been frowned upon for acquiring a stake in various companies like-the pboc enhancing its claim in hdfc to 1% and many other entities amidst panic selling. china also capitalized on low crude oil prices by creating massive buffers. it further exported ppe to various countries, capitalizing on the minutest of opportunities available.    this is the time to be prudent and try to remain optimistic as is illuminated by

45379.4,"“the more you know about the past, the better prepared you are for the future.”    theodore roosevelt    as we speak, the world finds itself engulfed in one of its worst crises in recent times. the global covid-19 pandemic has caused never-seen-before disruption in both public and economic life. not only have factories shut down or supply chains abruptly stopped or millions of workers stranded, but festivals suspended, families separated across countries and public-healthcare systems put under tremendous stress. such a scenario is a first-time for many, but the world has been through pandemics of a similar scale and nature before, and after the due struggle, emerged victoriously. as the more experienced amongst us would remember, the sars and mers outbreaks in the early 2000s presented a similar scenario, although at a much lower rate of infection, yet with higher rates of morbidity. going back further in time, the 1918 spanish flu brought a world just out of the first world war, to a standstill. considered to be the worst amongst modern-era pandemics, the influenza pandemic affected one-third of the world’s population and 50 million lives. yet, preventive measures such as social-distancing, quarantine, mass-vaccinations, public support, and restraint have proved to be successful in all such situations, even being effective in occasional plague outbreaks across the world. we face a similar situation today – an extremely infectious virus, which has already spread globally, confined people to their homes and is causing tremendous economic loss every minute economic activity remains suspended, affecting both the government and the industries alike.     can past similar incidents guide industries in such trying times? can our governments take note of how public-policy measures adopted during the spanish flu, sars and mers outbreak helped in eliminating such pandemics?    what can the government learn?    the panic due to the outbreak of covid-19, and more importantly, the lockdown measures to deal with it, are quite similar to those during the 1918 influenza pandemic, or as it is more commonly referred to as, the spanish flu. large cities around the world were put under strict lockdowns, and businesses worldwide came to a grinding halt as large chunks of the population became bedridden.    the immediate consequences were the same as the ones observed in the past few weeks – rampant unemployment, supply shortages, and heavy reliance on social security systems, causing a sudden strain on national economic resources.    impact & learnings    information & censorship    effective and transparent communications are one of the most crucial and useful tools in disease control. iran presents a great example of the damage that can be unleashed by a media-blackout. secondly, censorship might not be the best way to appease the masses during such times. the long-term political impact of media censorship and manipulation of epidemic-related facts in china is yet to be seen. still, the short-term international unrest and dissent have only deteriorated international relations. at the risk of quoting a cliché as well as the established streisand effect, the truth always comes out, no matter how many countries try to hide it.    isolation, lockdown & distancing mechanisms work    the spanish flu spread was aggravated due to the failure of policymakers in adopting effective containment measures. research shows that us cities which undertook measures to reduce contact amongst citizens in early-1918 displayed significantly lower peak death rates compared to cities that failed to or were too late to adopt disease containment policies.    to quote the results from this 2007 study, “consistent with this hypothesis, cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates ≈50% lower than those that did not and had less-steep epidemic curves. they also displayed lower cumulative mortality.”                                1: contrasting the death rates in philadelphia v. st. louis during the 1918 influenza outbreak    1: contrasting the death rates in philadelphia v. st. louis during the 1918 influenza outbreak    as one might guess, philadelphia was late to levy restrictions on gatherings, parades, and social distancing measures, whereas st. louis was not.    from the same study, we see the definition of a popular phrase “flattening the curve” emerging – which is spreading out the rate of infection over time, enabling health care systems to treat people in a staggered manner, in line with available resources. and, to further corroborate this result, the following graph from the same study shows the different trajectories followed by the disease in two cities of the us.    hence, regardless of the multiple debunking claims of social-distancing & lockdown as an effective preventive mechanism, previous epidemics have taught us that they perform a marvelous job at ‘flattening the curve’.    premature relaxation can be disastrous    social distancing & lockdown measures are effective, only if sustained, at least for a few months, even after things start to improve.    markel (2007), shows the disastrous consequences that the early relaxation of bans on public gatherings in st. louis had on death rates, during the spanish flu. the pullback of social distancing measures to pursue economic interests was premature and caused a sudden, unprecedented surge in the number of deaths due to the flu.     2: deaths due to the spanish flu in st. louis – a wider picture. the black & grey lines show the duration for which social-distancing measures were active.    2: deaths due to the spanish flu in st. louis – a wider picture. the black & grey lines show the duration for which social-distancing measures were active.    another peak in death rates was observed only in cities that had relaxed distancing measures prematurely. hence, it is crucial to consider this past artifact when governments compare the inconveniences to the public & damage caused to the economy due to such measures, with the benefits to the nation in terms of human life saved, and then make the call as to when the restrictions must be eased.    what can the industry learn?    the industry has played a key role in the obscure fight against the worldwide outbreak. but it faces its fair share of challenges, in such unprecedented times.    supply shortages, due to shut-down of factories & production houses and the uncertainty of when production systems would resume to normal functioning.transport disruptions, due to closure & quarantining of cities and state-borders; nation-wide lockdowns bringing all transportation to a standstill; significant disruptions in the supply-chains of most goods.labour issues, with restrictions on movement, come issues of labour welfare, unrest and employment security. this problem is even more serious if the labour force is migratory in nature.    global industries have weathered through multiple natural disasters and two epidemics of a similar scale and nature. their recovery-paths have immense strategic implications for current policy-makers and offer strategic insights, helping companies chart out their short-term & long-term strategies.    3: this graph looks at the retail sales impact of the sars epidemic in china in 2003; the earthquake, tsunami and fukushima nuclear disaster in japan in 2011; and the mers epidemic in south korea in 201.5    3: this graph looks at the retail sales impact of the sars epidemic in china in 2003; the earthquake, tsunami and fukushima nuclear disaster in japan in 2011; and the mers epidemic in south korea in 201.5    three phases characterise the impact on the retail market in all these three cases:    shockrecoverystabilization    the paths inevitably converge to stabilization but follow different trajectories, and are swayed by public perceptions and externalities, as in the case of the mid-autumn festival in south korea. looking at the retail sector from a micro-lens, past crises show that demand trends vary amongst product categories, both during and post the crisis. the three categories usually follow such trends:    demand trends during & post a pandemic-generated crisis    4: demand trends during & post a pandemic-generated crisis    4: demand trends during & post a pandemic-generated crisis[1]    these three trends are a valuable tool for both large scale players and regional retailers who now have the means to prioritize and predict consumer-demand and consequently alleviate a sudden strain on the product supply chain arising out of sudden & unexpected demands.    change in consumer behaviour    a peculiar outcome of such epidemics have been the somewhat permanent changes instilled in consumer buying trends across the inflicted regions, across product categories – fresh staples see a sharp rise in their demand and product hygiene & safety standards are ranked higher up in the consumers’ priority list. hence, the advantage lies with producers who can quickly integrate changed consumer-preferences in their products, showcase product reliability & quality, and priced competitively, given the prevalent context. lastly, previous pandemics have consolidated a long-standing theory, which is true not just for the retail sector but for any consumer-centric industry that there is, – consumer loyalty is tried and tested during these times. effective consumer relationship management (crm) can forge bonds that go a long way, weathering through the thick and thin in such unprecedented times.    implications    almost two decades ago, the sars outbreak in china had pushed entrepreneurs and established players to embrace the dawn of the e-commerce era. this outbreak is expected to accelerate further the shift from conventional brick-mortar based commerce to a centralized online cloud-store based mechanism. survival, in the fmcg sector at least, will be decided to a great extent by the breadth of the supply chain networks and the ability to overcome severe bottlenecks.    the past has shown that even though established large-scale players with deep pockets and extensive networks, have a likelier chance to tough it through these hard times, even the regional players & smes make it through, strengthened by community-support, empathy and most importantly, local relationships.    what did we fail to learn?    this global pandemic outbreak has made one thing painfully clear – there is a lack of global collaborative research on ways to combat the spread of such infectious diseases. in the words of johan neyts, professor of virology and president of the belgian-based, international society for antiviral research (isar), health authorities failed to incorporate the learnings of the sars outbreak of the early 2000s, partly because of the economic crisis of 2008 which squeezed funds from any potential research that could have been undertaken and partly because of the lack of seriousness in authorities in considering the efforts involved in dealing with the future expected breaks of coronavirus due to its seven different strains in existence.     the way forward?    all of these lessons come with a caveat – things change with time. the modes of communication have changed. both information & travel is much more accessible now. we have fast planes & faster internet. we have better healthcare capabilities and a much better, if not perfect, healthcare system. in 1918, people didn’t even know that a virus was causing the pandemic until much after its eradication. today, we already have extensive research going on for 70 different probable vaccines for the virus, with a record setting pace in clinical trials and approvals.    we are much better equipped than what we were 100 years ago, and at the same time, somewhat under-equipped to deal with it. but these lessons from the various similar crises that humanity has faced and risen from, act as a glimmer of hope in these dire times, and if put to good use, can aid in the fight against covid-19. in the words of howard markel, “there’s never been a better time in human history to have a pandemic than today, with the exception of next week or a month later. you want to kick that can down the road, but it’s here today.”",53,82,-0.21481481322359397,0.12140287769784172,10.901960784313726,0.11658238731583626,4.407417268651825,129.63961469520993,1112,2.6636690647482015,4,6.748201438848921
45841.2,"the current topic that is burning the world alive is the deadly coronavirus. let us first understand what this coronavirus actually is. according to the world health organization (who), the coronavirus disease which is called the covid-19 is an infectious disease which is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus. the covid-19 virus is a virus that affects different people of the world in different ways. the covid-19 disease is a respiratory disease and most of the infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without even requiring special treatment.  the people who already have underlying medical conditions and those people who are over 60 years old have a higher risk of developing severe disease and death.    common symptoms include:    fevertirednessdry cough.    other symptoms include:    shortness of breathaches and painssore throatand very few people in the world will report diarrhea, nausea, or a runny nose.    the people living in this world who have only mild symptoms of this deadly disease but are otherwise healthy should self-isolate and contact their medical provider or a covid-19 information line for advice on testing and referral. the people who have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should call their doctor and seek medical attention.    some key lessons from the deadly disease coronavirus: in the last 3 months, there has been a drastic change to human life all around the world. the coronavirus outbreak happening in the world is no more just an epidemic but it is also considered as a global pandemic now. the people everywhere in the world are being asked to stay home and stay away from other people so as to reduce the risk of infection.    the deadly disease coronavirus has brought with it a wave of negative outcomes, terrible illness, and death, but at the same time it has also highlighted some important life lessons. some of them are as follows:    1. you should be willing to trade some of your freedom for the greater good of the public: there is no doubt for anyone that it has been difficult for everyone in the world to stay at home. many people complaining about feeling bored and aimless. some people may even have the feeling that it is a breach of their individual rights, being made to stay home. however, when it comes to the greater good, one should always be willing to sacrifice a little bit of that freedom. a balance between individual rights and public safety is an ever-changing thing. trade a little bit of your freedom for the greater good of the public.    2. you should wash your hands, whether there’s a virus or not: general hygiene is always important. not just when there is a virus. you should know the drill by now. wet your hands. lather them with soap. scrub for 20 seconds. rinse off. dry with a clean towel. washing hands on a regular basis are really the best way to keep safe because soap is a very effective way to kill viruses.    3. working from home should be an option for many: in this time of the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease, many people have learned that their jobs were possible to do from home. most jobs have a certain amount of work that can be done remotely. without the virus in place, there should still be some system in place that will promote work-life balance.    4. taking that sick day from the work could save lives: if you are feeling sick at any day in this situation, it is highly beneficial that you just stay home. it is a common feeling among lots of people that their office environment does not encourage taking sick days. many people want to appear like martyrs to their managers. this mentality needs to stop. if you are sick, just stay home.    5. the internet should be a basic right: according to a study done by the university of birmingham, the right to internet access, also known as the right to broadband, should be considered a human right. many people from all over the world are unable to get online, particularly the people who live in developing countries, and so they lack meaningful ways to influence the global players shaping their everyday lives. in addition to this, during times like these, it is especially important to be able to contact family, friends, and work from home if necessary. the internet is the only way to do so.    6. the doctors and the researchers need to be paid better: if this scary time has taught us anything, it’s that doctors and researchers will be the ones who get us out of this mess. the doctors and the researchers are the only ones who are working day and night to drive the recovery of the world. at the moment, hundreds of scientists scramble to find a coronavirus treatment. it is high time for us that we need to re-evaluate how much money hollywood actors, pro-athletes, and politicians make and instead pay the scientist and the doctors the salary they deserve.    7. everyone should know how to cook: the situation that has forced everyone to stay at home has forced many people to learn, re-learn, or re-ignite their love for cooking. learning how to cook is to have one of the most important skills in life. you depend on yourself. it teaches you self-sustainability and you save a lot of money. these days, hundreds of people sharing social media posts of their delicious meals. they are re-discovering the wonders of eating in.    8. the importance of talking to friends every day: now that we can’t go out and keep busy, the best way to combat loneliness is to be in regular contact with friends and family, by chatting over the phone or video chatting. this is the time to have long talks and deep conversations. don’t forget human connection during these crucial times. call your grandma!    9. learn to appreciate nature: if you live near a spacious outdoor area, like the desert or an empty road lined with trees and you realize it is the only safe, surface-less space to take a walk in, then you start to realize how beautiful nature actually is. the point is not to remain indoors, but to avoid being in close contact with others. when you do leave your home, whether it is for a walk in the desert or a run on your street, make sure to wipe down any surfaces with which you come into contact and at the same time also avoid touching your face and frequently wash your hands.    10. learn how to be content alone: it is so hard for some people to just be still and do nothing. being alone, especially for extroverts can be exhausting and lonely. social distancing can be very difficult, but it can also teach you a lot about yourself. you learn how to keep yourself busy. your body and mind is your home and you have to learn how to love it and live with it.    conclusion: it is rightly said that it is important to learn from the past. the deadly coronavirus disease that is taking the lives of so many people across the world, has taught so many life lessons to the people living in it. these lessons are not meant to be forgotten but are to be remembered by human beings in order to make the earth a beautiful place to live in. lastly, i would like to conclude by mentioning that “stay at home. stay safe. save lives”.",49,55,-0.05769230713757397,0.1664,6.127450980392157,0.03643199603619883,2.4655531905713426,22.76999752262427,625,2.4832,4,6.0832

46764.8,"india has been beset by financial scams since independence. every 4-5 years, indian citizens hear about so many trillions of public money being misappropriated and eventually lost by people who the public is supposed to start. in this article, with examples, i would like to point out that there are two factors to scams like nirav modi: the complicity of actors within the financial industry and the systemic loopholes in an emerging financial system that has been used for scams like nirav modi.
 
 
 
 the first financial scam of independent india was found in 1958 when feroze gandhi, mp found that in 1957, haridas mundhra got the government-owned life insurance corporation (lic) to invest rs. 12.4 million (about us$3.2 million at the time) in the shares of six troubled companies of whom mundhra held a large number of shares which he was trying to boost by rigging the market. the investment was done under governmental pressure and bypassed the lic’s investment committee, which was informed of this decision only after the deal had gone through. in the event, lic lost most of the money. several leading stockbrokers who were on the lic investment committee testified that the investment could not have been made for the purpose of propping up the market, as was claimed by the finance ministry, and that had the lic consulted the investment committee, they would have pointed out mundhra’s forged shares episode from 1956. the finance minister t. t. krishnamachari, in his testimony, tried to distance himself from the lic decision, implying that it may have been taken by the finance secretary, but justice m.c. chagla held that the minister is constitutionally responsible for the action taken by his secretary and he disowns his actions. eventually, krishanamachari had to resign. the nehru government suffered considerable loss of prestige in the incident.
 
 
 
 the 1992 indian stock market scam was a stock market scam orchestrated by harshad mehta. the scam took place in mumbai and was the biggest market scam of india. the 1992 scam was a systematic stock fraud using bank receipts and stamp paper which caused the indian stock market to crash. the scam lead to a complete structural change of the security system of india and introduced a completely new system of stock transactions. the 1992 scam exposed the indian financial systems through the inherent loopholes of the system. this scam led to the reform of the security system of india and introduced online security systems. the scam was orchestrated in such a way that mehta secured securities from the state bank of india against forged cheques signed by corrupt officials and failed to deliver the securities. mehta made the prices of the stocks soar high through fictitious practices and would go on to sell the stocks that he owned in these companies. the 1992 scam raises many questions which involved many bank officials responsible for collusion with mehta. the 1992 scam caused an investigation through which many officials were implicated in fraudulent charges. the security system of india took a rapid reform in its fundamental structure post the 1992 scam. the first major structural change was the formation of the national stock exchange of india (nse). the first major reform in the financial sector of india was the formation of the cii code for desirable corporate governance developed by rahul bajaj. post-1992, a new regulatory board known as the securities and exchange board of india was formed to monitor the national stock exchange and the national securities depository. there were structural changes in the equity market. the government introduced ten acts of parliament and one constitutional amendment based upon the principles of economic reform and legislative change for the equity market. the nse introduced online trading in 1994 which changed the dynamics of stock buying and selling. the capital market now opened up nationally as opposed to being confined in mumbai. the exchange system started functioning based on satellite communications that abolished geographical barriers.
 
 
 
 in 2001, ketan parekh purchased large stakes in less known small market capitalization companies and jacked up their prices through circular trading with other traders, and collusion with these companies and large institutional investors. this resulted in steep hikes in share prices. it later transpired that promoters and industrialists often gave parekh funds to artificially rig up their share prices. this set of ten stocks was colloquially referred to as “k-10” stocks and parekh was playfully referred to as “pentafour”. the rbi commenced an investigation against parekh. around the same time, a bear cartel of brokers in mumbai opposed to parekh tried to dump their shares of k-10 stocks. panicking, parekh sold off his entire ownership of the so-called k-10 stocks that he had successfully jacked up over the past two years. this resulted in a stock market crash the next day, resulting in large-scale losses for large institutional investors, including insurance companies and mutual funds. a 30 member joint parliamentary committee (jpc) investigation ensued which found that parekh had been involved in circular trading throughout the time period from and with a variety of companies.
 
 
 
 when the securities exchange board of india (sebi) started scanning an entire spectrum of ipos launched over 2003, 2004, and 2005, it ended digging up more dirt and probably prevented a larger conspiracy to hijack the market. it involved the manipulation of the primary market—read initial public offers (ipos)—by financiers and market players by using fictitious or benaami demat accounts. they then transferred the shares to financiers, who sold on the first day of listing, making windfall gains from the price difference between the ipo price and the listing price. this time, fraudsters targeted the primary market to make a quick buck at the expense of the gullible small investors. direct participants (dps) used retail applicants’ shares for reaping benefits in the stock market.
 
 
 
 the 2010 fake housing loan in india was uncovered by the central bureau of investigation (cbi) in india. cbi arrested eight top-ranking officials of public sector banks and financial institutions, including the lic housing finance ceo ramchandran nair, in connection with the scam. cbi alleged that the officers of various public sector banks and financial institutions received bribes from a private financial services company, which acted as a mediator for corporate loans and other facilities from financial institutions. the bank officials sanctioned large-scale corporate loans to realty developers, overriding mandatory conditions for such approvals along with other irregularities.
 
 
 
 the thane police, struggling to crack down on the tax refund scam that has taken the income tax department for a ride and defrauded the central exchequer of around rs 3 crore, has concluded that the scam involved high-ranking officials from the i-t department and the state bank of india. the fraud-involving two i-t offices in thane and kalyan was planned by those familiar with the i-t office functioning. for over two years, 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, the i-t officials disbursed tax refund cheques drawn from the sbi and credited into the account of fictitious assessees in a credit society in dombivli. as many as 331 such tax refund cheques, some exceeding rs 1 lakh, were subsequently routed to the dombivli nagri cooperative bank and funds withdrawn. the i-t refunds are account payee cheques, which can’t be transferred. despite this, all 331 refund orders were credited to the third-party account of a credit society.
 
 
 
 the saradha group financial scandal was a major financial scam and alleged political scandal caused by the collapse of a ponzi scheme run by saradha group, a consortium of over 200 private companies that were believed to be running collective investment schemes popularly but incorrectly referred to as chit funds in eastern india. it was feared that legitimate non-banking financial companies and microfinance institutions would be stigmatized, leading to a vicious cycle of low depositor trust, higher interest rates, lower lending and a localized credit crisis. because most of the saradha group depositors came from the lowest economic strata, the loss of the investment would cause a further decrease in social mobility. the scandal drew attention to similar illegal deposit mobilizing companies, which are facing increased regulatory pressure. many of these companies have been variations of timeshare travel schemes, of which there are few clear regulations. in august 2013, the central government amended the sebi act and gave sebi powers to search and seize without prior magisterial permission to investigate illegal money collection schemes.
 
 
 
 nsel case relates to a payment default at the national spot exchange limited that occurred in 2013 involving financial technologies india ltd when a payment default took place after a commodities market regulator, the forward markets commission (fmc), directed nsel to stop launching contracts. this led to the closure of the exchange in july 2013. three spot exchanges, nsel, nspot, and national apmc were exempted by the government under section 27 of fcra to conduct forward trading in one-day contracts. this was done to boost volumes so that their economic viability improved. on the flawed recommendations of the fmc, the ministry of consumer affairs ordered nsel to settle all existing contracts and not launch any fresh contracts, which led to the crisis. investigations led by enforcement directorate (ed) and economic offences wing (eow) revealed the role of brokers and defaulters in the nsel case. the brokers mis-sold nsel products to their clients by assuring them of fixed returns. the defaulters hypothecated stocks and produced fake warehouse receipts and siphoned the entire default money. fiu (under finance ministry) held that nsel came under the purview of the forwarding contracts (regulation) act (fcra) and therefore guilty of failing in several of these obligations under the law. the black money watchdog has slapped a penalty of rs 1.66 crore for several counts of violating the provisions of the prevention of money laundering act (pmla) on nsel. the watchdog further held that failures are deliberate and willful and hence, invite penalties.

 the punjab national bank fraud case relates to the fraudulent letters of undertaking worth ₹11,356.84 crores (us$ 1.4 billion) issued by the punjab national bank at its brady house branch in fort, mumbai; making punjab national bank liable for the amount. the fraud was allegedly organized by jeweler and designer nirav modi. nirav, his wife ami modi, brother nishal modi and uncle mehul choksi, all partners of the firms, m/s diamond r us, m/s solar exports and m/s stellar diamonds; along with pnb officials and employees, and directors of nirav modi and mehul choksi’s firms have all been named in a charge sheet by the cbi. the bank initially said that two of its employees at the branch were involved in the scam, as the bank’s core banking system was bypassed when the corrupt employees issued lous to overseas branches of other indian banks, including allahabad bank, axis bank, and union bank of india, using the international financial communication system, swift. on 1 march 2018, the government approved the fugitive economic offenders bill to deter economic offenders from evading the process of indian law by giving powers to the government to confiscate assets of a fugitive, including benami assets of absconding loan defaulters. the bill covers a wide range of economic offenders which include: loan defaulters, fraudsters, individuals who violate laws governing taxes, black money, benami properties, the financial sector, and corruption. in march 2018, the reserve bank of india scrapped banking instruments such as the letter of understanding (lou) and letter of comfort (loc) that in an attempt to plug a loophole and improve banks’ due diligence in trade credit. some bankers said that lous and locs led to receiving banks depending completely on the issuing bank on creditworthiness.
 
 
 
 as seen in all the above cases for scams like nirav modi, the two factors: action taken by the insiders or systemic loopholes were responsible for the majority of the indian financial scams. the improvement in the industry will only come when all the loopholes are closed down and accountability is given and held to all the people working in the industry.",51,92,-0.2867132847082987,0.11163153786104606,12.558823529411764,0.1122105477914924,5.068413630881303,143.74171172090175,1281,2.5932864949258394,3,6.670569867291179
47226.6,"it was 14th march and i was altogether prepared for my last theater competition of this very year.     i only knew in my core how much this competition meant for me. in the morning i made some last-minute calls to my diligent team who were ceaselessly practicing for the past few days to confirm to me that they were all coming for the competition because of the alarming coronavirus ball game going outside the market. it was not like i wasn’t aware of the situation but i believed that i would be able to handle it because there’s a quote in theatre that says, “fear is only as deep as the mind allows” and to some length i was fearless. my passion, fondness, and attachment for the theatre were above all the notices and announcements that we’re rolling out.        but then at once, i received a call from mr. sandeep, the head of the event who told me that the event is put off till the next few days and from that precise moment onwards the journey of hard and strenuous days began and it in point of fact felt like it was all meant to happen. the competition was postponed, the team was stuck in their homes grudgingly, time was haunting us all because of this coronavirus. these were some of the cardinal ways in which this virus affected us but there was more to this sickness. this very sickness acted like a sadist. i was impressed as i found someone who could act better than me. it has reversed the ways we used to work, play and exercise and the world solution that was asked to practice by the professionals were social distancing.         this virus was wild and dangerous towards the people who are in declining health conditions but obviously it could not take off his hands from the young people as well. the coronavirus cases and deaths were heightening to a great extent. also the major problem that came in the light was people being fully unprepared and this led to the public becoming snappier, intolerant and non-supportive needless to say as this virus was acting like a sadist. but by all means, our government knows how to best handle the affairs, they decided to shut down schools, colleges, bars anything that would involve the gathering of more than 10 people. with disinformation coming from all around related to this infection it becomes hard to judge for the audience what is true and what is false and it worsens when the public consumes this information by working from home. this virus was not only hollowing people from deep inside but was also supporting and increasing some other country-related issues one of which is fake news which is a serious problem.    with fake news traveling around the world, people come and start to blabber. people start offering numerous solutions and want that most of the people should follow it. they start acting like saints who know all the solutions to this pandemic. some of the solutions are convenient to follow but some are not and are unhealthy which creates immense confusion and arguments. but the best way to stop the confusion and to avoid these people is to avoid their arguments and to not convince them with your points because it is rightly said a man convinced against his will is of the same opinions still. the thing to do is to look after your family and to avoid shady and deceitful people.    but one thing that can’t be avoided is our expanding and maturing industries that lend a hand in developing our nation but no power to choose is left with our industries but to be at a standstill in this current moment as coronavirus right now is winning the game. the untold number of industries is growing down and a major one is our tourism industries and if this continues to happen then in no time there will be a loss to jobs close to more than 75 million. many working people like in the tourism industry and not only in this peculiar industry but also in various others, people are getting suspended because of a hefty amount of lost revenue. one of my own family members resorted to this issue by working for free for the next few months in order to at least protect her job. who should be blamed for these kinds of situations is also a point of concern for many people.    “massive hunger will definitely kill the poor before this virus”, this statement takes my immediate attention. what options are left with the daily-wage earners? i would say no option. they are the ones who are in the most condemning situations. lockdown for us can be a way to relax or listen to karaoke, but lockdown for them means an end to their life. unquestionably, this decision by our prime minister is the best he could take but when the best turns out to be the worst for someone then i think it’s a moment to question. going to the internet and writing what’s the best way to spend this quarantine, should definitely be what’s the best way in which we can help people, but naturally, this would not interest many people. furthermore, this set off to become more hell when people start with the activity of stockpiling. unnecessary piling of food is altogether a reason for shortage and ultimately hunger.        my maid mala who is a housewife and has a small suffering family, i believe could have written this article in a better manner if she would have the relevant education because she is the actual prey to this problem. she being the patient will exactly know the impact this virus can have on our lives because sitting in our homes with a cup coffee can never let us know what an empty cup feels like. mala said to me think how much we would be tolerating that our prime minister apologized to the public for this lockdown which was certainly a good thing for the masses. what all i could do to help her was to provide her family with some money and eatables. a small contribution with some motivation and a call once in 2 days i believe will not improve her state completely but would certainly provide her with the power to deal with it.  not only mala and her family, but there are also millions of people who are in the exact same condition. there are countless mala in our country who are panicking, enduring and suffering each night with no food in their stomachs. imagine an exact same situation for yourselves, it would without fail be the hardest situation. this is the impact a virus can create. for sure this article can be of endless pages owing to the fact that there are more stories to     to this and each story is painful that the other.    labor chowk in noida has numerous stories of people conveying their problems and asking for help. this chowk is in the main know for men looking for work. quite a few men gather there each morning to get some work in order to feed their families with at least a roti but this virus even snatched that from their plates. a very known movie in our indian cinemas is “coolie” that says these laborers should get their pay till their sweat dries up. these people anyhow need money each day to feed their families but after these uncontrollable situations they at times are forced to eat filth and muck and this sickness might not kill these people but hunger and stained water definitely will. these stories will never end because it’s all meant to happen but i hope this situation does in order to provide some relief to them.        also how one would imagine that the movie “six feet’s apart” would be acted in reality. the solutions related to this pandemic came swiftly and rapidly with the help and support of your doctors and nurses who all were serving us and the sufferers round-the-clock. solutions like washing your hands for at least 20 seconds correctly, covering your mouth with a face mask and majorly avoiding unnecessary wandering on the streets and keeping yourself away from unhygienic people were asked to follow. the efforts of our doctors, nurses, government officials made me realize that my passion should not be above these notices and announcements but should move hand in hand with it.         right at this moment we all are moving with these circumstances and nobody knows what might happen in the future but one thing is of sure that nobody can ever forget this situation and indeed me as it had the ability to knock down my event that day. many lessons were learned by all the world in these days some being that never ever take anything for granted because if that thing or that person leaves then life tends to become like a rock. appreciate, admire and cherish whatever you have because you never know when it might leave you, ask from them who have just lost someone from this corona virus. moments to live happily in this world are very few spend it with someone who makes you feel loved. each day sun rises with a new hope to make a habit to feel the warmth and wish for a healthy life for yourself, your family and this world. together we all are fighting this virus with unity.",56,65,-0.0743801646745441,0.16285329744279947,7.284313725490196,0.033517436353302926,2.9271324647373995,24.903455210504074,743,2.421265141318977,5,6.05921938088829
4741.0,"“society can exist without marketing, but marketing cannot exist without society.”    marketing is the management process of anticipating, identifying, and satisfying customers’ requirements. the various conventional marketing tools are advertising, branding, direct marketing, sales promotion, publicity, and public relations. critics acknowledge that marketing has legitimate uses in as much as it connects goods and services to consumers who desire them. however, some aspects of marketing, especially promotion and advertisements, are subject to criticism. they argue that product promotion is an attempt by the goods and service providers to influence demand. advertising has become such an inextricable part of our lives that one cannot imagine life without it. although we hardly ever notice, advertisements leave an indelible mark on our minds, especially on vulnerable groups like children and adolescents.       the commensuration of the two words raises eyebrows in marketing and society, as it is highly debatable. on the one hand, society thrives on companies’ marketing efforts, while another school of thought argues that marketing makes society more materialistic. today, striking a balance between the two is the challenge marketers face. ethical expectations are a vital part of the business environment. society expects businesses to be honest and desires corporate executives, at all levels, to apply ethical principles- in other words, guidelines as to what is right and wrong, fair and unfair, and morally correct- when they make business decisions. for better or worse, marketing is everywhere, with the allure of new products, big promises, and hope for something new or different. as we turn on the television or scroll through social media feeds, we will find it hard to avoid someone trying to sell us something. while advertising and marketing share information and tell us what is new, it does so to persuade rather than educate, so their influence can sometimes be more harmful than positive.       the debate about the positives and negatives of advertising is a bit like the infamous chicken or egg question. some people claim that marketing causes adverse effects, while others argue that it merely reflects what is already happening in the culture. for all the positive potential of marketing, the reality is that it frequently influences society in negative ways. one negative aspect of marketing is its potential to feed into unrealistic expectations, breed discontentment, and influence our thought processes in ways beyond our control. materialism, workaholism, unhealthy lifestyle habits, alcoholism, politics, and unrealistic views negatively shape our culture and impact the most vulnerable.       according to research, marketing has become increasingly hostile in the modern television era. consumers are often disturbed by advertisements & marketing, and negative campaign ads tend to fuel a vicious cycle where both sides fling ads back and forth in a futile, narcissistic, tantrum-like attempt to make their opponents look worse and worse while making themselves look better. marketing aims to present a product in the best light possible. there is some leeway in the creative process. the problem arises when dramatization crosses the line into falsely representing a product. hefty fines can result from false advertising when levied by the authorities.    marketing and advertising are ingrained in the modern culture, from children’s programs on saturday mornings to talk shows and prime-time tv. advertising even invades movies through product placement. marketing influences how people feel about themselves and often turns out negative. widespread concern exists about the potential effects of media portrayals of drinking, alcohol product placements, and alcohol advertising on alcohol consumption and problems among young people. television, radio, film, and popular music are often identified as potential sources through which young people learn about alcohol and as possible influences on young people’s drinking and drinking problems. even though campaign advertising has been a part of politics, scholars are still conflicted over the effects of different advertising strategies. as a result, the literature on political advertising is vast and multifaceted. conventional wisdom holds that political advertising, in general, is harmful to democracy. further, the adverse effects of advertising on teenagers include increased cigarette and alcohol use, obesity, poor nutrition, and eating disorders, according to pediatrics, the official journal of the american academy of pediatrics.    advertisers are traditionally using techniques to which children and adolescents are more susceptible, such as product placement in tv shows and tie-ins between movies and fast-food restaurants, to mention a few. it’s all kid’s play anyway, with today’s youngsters having profound influence over purchases in all product categories. many marketing evils lure people into buying even when not required. however, the picture of the relationship between marketing and society is contested. marketing has often been criticized for encouraging excessive consumption, self-indulgent lifestyle, and producing a consumer culture where products and services are the core of social identity at the expense of other ‘traditional’ values.       just as in an underdeveloped economy, marketing can be an avenue for publicity of indigenous products and services, thereby generating income; similarly, in developing and developed economies, where competition for the share of the customer’s pocket is high, marketing can lead to attitudinal and lifestyle changes and problems. free collectible coupons or tattoos inside chips packets, and other such advertising gimmicks and tactics do not add any value to the product being offered but only lure consumers into buying a product they otherwise may not have purchased- leading to another group of people who entice these students to enroll for a weight reduction program! sex is used in commercials to sell everything from beer to shampoo to cars. new research shows that teenagers’ exposure to sexual content in the media may be responsible for the earlier onset of sexual intercourse or other sexual activities leading to an increased number of hiv-positive cases.    alcohol producers spend $ 5.7 billion/per year on advertising and promotions. research has found that adolescent drinkers are more likely to have been exposed to alcohol advertising. studies confirm a direct link between junk food advertisements and obesity among adolescents.    as we move ahead with technology and change the marketing strategy with the growing consumerism, it is vital to be cautious. our cautiousness can only decide what happens in the future regarding marketing.",33,47,-0.17499999781250003,0.13029315960912052,6.019607843137255,0.09472318969411697,2.4457324131325486,58.16003847218782,614,2.8908794788273617,2,7.252442996742671
47688.4,"nathan wolfe impact once said “there are commonalities among all the pandemics that occur and what we can learn from them. one commonality is that it comes from animals and the other one is that we wait too long.”    in the year 1720 plague, in the year 1820 cholera outbreak and the most recent pandemic was the spanish flu of 1920. the researchers said that all of these pandemics above have exactly the same pattern as the coronavirus outbreak. however, the precision with which these pandemics occur at exactly 100 years of age makes us think better about this topic.     coronavirus disease (covid-19) is one such infectious disease that has been declared a global pandemic by who. most people infected with the covid-19 virus experience mild to moderate illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illnesses. the best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the covid-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. people can protect themselves and others from infection by washing their hands or using an alcohol-based sanitizer frequently and by not touching their face.     the covid-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquettes (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow, etc). at this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for covid-19. however, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments.    the first case of this pandemic in india was reported on january 30th,2020. after which it has increased substantially around the country to such an extent that the indian prime minister announced a 21-day lockdown around the country.    rating agencies, both global and domestic, are unanimous that the covid-19 pandemic will be an economic tsunami for india. even though the country may not slip into a recession, unlike the eurozone, the us, or asia-pacific that have stronger trade ties to china, analysts believe the impact on india’s gdp growth will be significant. the fallout of the move will spill over to the financial year 2021, which begins on april 1.     moody’s investors service, on march 27, sharply slashed its projection for india’s gdp growth in the calendar year 2020 from 5.3% to 2.5%. the markdown was the second in 10 days and came after prime minister narendra modi announced the 21-day lockdown. in its global macro outlook 2020-21, moody’s cited severe liquidity constraints in india’s banking and non-banking sectors as a hindrance to growth. the agency’s forecast for the global economy was even more stark—a contraction of 0.5% in the ongoing financial year.    “lower business volumes and occupancies, and sub-optimal efficiencies will impact the profitability of companies. while some affected companies may initiate cost-curtailment measures, these may not be enough given their high fixed costs. that could impair their credit files,” says subodh rai, senior director, crisil.     neeraj kumar, a migrant worker, decided to flee. he and his family joined a throng of people leaving the city soon after the lockdown announcement was made. public transport systems were stopped, leaving people with no choice but to walk. mr. kumar, his wife, and their 10-year-old daughter had already walked more than 40km (24 miles) when we spoke to him. “there is no work here, that is why we are running away. there are no buses, i have to walk another 260km to get to my village,” he said.    the situation of workers following the lockdown is no better. mohammad alam is one of the thousands of workers standing in a food queue in india’s capital, delhi.    the factory where he worked has shut down after prime minister narendra modi announced a 21-day lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus.    a daily-wage laborer, he has no other source of income, so he has been forced to come to a government center for food. “i don’t know how i will survive; i will have to borrow to feed my family,” he says.    india has announced a $23bn (£18bn) relief package to help people like mr. alam and mr. kumar who are part of india’s unorganized, informal industry that employs 94% of the population and contributes 45% to its overall output. this industry is already bearing the brunt of the lockdown with thousands of finding themselves unemployed overnight. “no-one will be allowed to go hungry,” finance minister nirmala sitharaman said while announcing the package – a combination of direct cash transfer benefits and food security measures.    but the economic fallout of this unprecedented lockdown has been dire. businesses have closed, unemployment has risen and productivity has fallen. india’s growth engine was actually sputtering well before the threat of the outbreak arrived. once one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, its growth slowed to 4.7% last year – the lowest level in six years.    unemployment was at a 45-year high last year. the industrial output from the eight-core sectors at the end of last year fell by 5.2% – the worst in 14 years. small businesses had only just begun to recover from the controversial 2016 currency ban that came as a body blow to the cash-consuming informal economy. now, experts say the coronavirus outbreak is likely to further cripple the already frail economy.    there is little finance minister nirmala sitharaman and rbi governor shatikanta das can do if covid-19 forces a virtual lockdown of commercial hubs in india, like it had done in china and has in italy. lights out in mumbai and delhi alone, the nerve centers of india, will cause great damage to the indian economy. indeed, covid-19 can be a massive blow to the slowing indian economy, particularly small business, the sme sector which had recently shown improvement since demonetization took place.    this is a war-like situation for the indian economy as the malls and theatres are empty. schools are shut for contingencies and some states have even announced a complete shutdown of all services. so while most welcome the government’s measures, they feel much more is needed to be done to minimize the economic impact. “while free extra rations have been sanctioned, how will the poor access what is due to them?” wonders economist arun kumar.    “the government should devise a way of using the army and state machinery to physically distribute food to the poor.” with thousands of migrant workers stuck miles away from their homes, the seamless distribution of cash and food needs to be the government’s top priority, he adds. and it’s not just migrant workers at risk. farmers are also vulnerable to a potential economic shock from the lockdown – the agriculture industry contributes nearly $265bn to gdp. the government says it will give farmers 2,000 rupees ($30) in april as an advance payment from an $80 annual pay-out to tide over the situation.    “this money will be inadequate because exports have stopped. prices in cities will rise because of profiteering and in rural areas they will drop because farmers won’t be able to sell their crop,” says economist arun kumar. the outbreak has happened at a critical farming time – the new crop is ready, waiting to be sold.     economists warn india’s challenge will be in transporting this food from villages to cities in the midst of the lockdown. if supply chains don’t work properly, a lot of food will be wasted and lead to massive losses for indian farmers. experts warn that india is also at the brink of a major unemployment crisis. economist vivek kaul says people who work for small businesses may end up with job and salary losses. “i know of places where companies are actively discussing how many people they need to fire,” he says and that’s not all.     while no sector is immune to covid-19 disruption, some are more vulnerable. the tourism industry will see greater disruptions. the world travel and tourism council calculated that tourism generated 9.2% of the gdp and supported 42.673 million jobs. tourism dependent states like kerala, karnataka earn huge forex but if the disease continues many operators will be forced to go out of the business.    in the exports industry while the gloom and doom surrounding covid-19 are palpable, the crisis might also throw up some great opportunities for india. there are already reports of several western manufacturers looking at moving their factories out of china. many indian chemical producers have gone on record at having received inquiries from western manufacturers who earlier never used to look towards india as a source. tapping these opportunities, however, will require some serious innovation on the policy front. indian policymakers need to hunker down and plan economic assistance that will not only help india’s export sector survive the immediate crisis but also retain stability and resume growth in the medium to long-term.    with flights suspended until mid-april, the shutdown is also bound to push india’s fast-growing aviation industry into peril. the centre for asia pacific aviation (capa) has assessed that the indian aviation industry will post losses worth nearly $4bn this year. this will likely have a cascading effect, affecting the hospitality and tourism industries. hotels and restaurant chains across the country are empty and are likely to remain so for several months, sparking worries of large-scale layoffs. the automobile industry, a key indicator of a country’s economic growth, has also been forced to hit the brakes – experts are estimating losses of nearly $2bn.    so, is india’s relief package enough?    experts say it’s a drop in the ocean compared to bailouts in countries such as the us, china and singapore the stimulus package constituting about 0.8 percent of fy20 gdp, is not at par to address the urgent needs of smaller businesses. experts say that india definitely needs a larger stimulus package soon to help businesses this extraordinary crisis.    desperate times call for desperate measures. india has done well in containing this dangerous virus but should act swiftly and decisively, to protect its economy. clearly there is a need for greater fiscal-monetary coordination to ensure an optimal policy

48150.2,"introduction    coronavirus disease  (covid-19)  is an infectious disease caused by a  newly discovered coronavirus.    most people infected with this covid-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory disease and recover without requiring special treatment. older age people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.    the best way to prevent and slow down transmission is well informed about the covid-19  virus,  the disease it causes and how it spreads.  protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently and not touching your face.    the  covid-19  virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharges from the nose when an infected person suffering from coughs or sneezes, so it is important that you also practice respiratory etiquette  (for example,  by coughing into a flexed elbow).    at this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for this virus. however, there are many ongoing clinical trials calculating potential treatments. which will continue to provide regular basis information as soon as clinical findings become available    impact    the emergence of covid-19 is a tragic public-health emergency. the disease, one hopes, will be brought under control quickly, but the international monetary fund is already warning that economic growth in  china may slow.  as we watch the situation unfold, three broader risks to the global economy are also becoming more apparent and clear.    the first risk is obviously in china itself. while the precise origins of the disease remain unclear, it is hard to take a definite view on whether outbreaks of this kind could be avoided – for example, by better control over hygiene in food markets. but it is painfully obvious that a lack of transparency in china has contributed to fear and even signs of panic around the world.    as financial markets go down in 2007-2008, when the precise incidence of big risks is not well understood, people tend to assume the worse. rapidly falling asset prices may not contain much information–except that there is not much information to be had.    the chinese authorities surely do not have all the answers at this point, but their inclination to suppress data and interpretation is tremendously unhelpful.    second, the lack of american leadership is more painfully apparent every day. the united states has the strongest medical-health system and facilities in the world, with the capacity for research and development  (government and private)  that is second to none.  yet  president  donald  trump’s administration seems to be concerned primarily with playing down the risks while keeping the virus out of the united states of america – a nearly impossible task.    the private sector is working hard on a  vaccine,  and this is commendable. unfortunately,  over a  longer period of time,  the lack of a  consistent market for such vaccines has undermined investment in this sector. by creating the world’s largest market for many drugs, the us effectively supports research across a wide range of ailments – but only those for which there is large and steady demand in the us.    even the most fervent believer in  trump’s  “america  first”  must be willing to concede that it is not in america’s interest for the rest of the world to become sick. these are us allies, friends, and customers. also, like it or not, few diseases will stop at  america’s borders.  indeed,  the  us  centers for  disease  control and prevention (cdc) has said that the question is not if, but rather when, covid-19 spreads domestically.    the third risk is in emerging markets and developing countries. poorer countries are ill-equipped to deal with this kind of disease,  as seen in  african countries’ refusal to airlift their citizens from china.    the news that the coronavirus has reached  italy has shaken world financial markets,  but  italy is a  relatively well-organized and rich country. a vibrant democracy ensures that people will quickly understand if containment and treatment measures are working.    we should be much more concerned about other countries, where nutrition is worse, housing standards are weak, and disease transmission can occur much more readily. if these countries’ health systems come under pressure, the us, europe, and others should step up quickly with technical assistance and essential supplies. but here, too, there is so far a worrying lack of leadership.    it seems unlikely that this disease will prove to be as deadly as some of those that our ancestors experienced. medical practice and public health have advanced a great deal. the  cdc  is an outstanding organization,  and the  world  health organization has a  strong track record when the chips are down. private-sector groups of dedicated doctors and nurses have performed extraordinarily well under the most difficult circumstances, such as dealing with ebola, when they are given a chance. we are fortunate to live in an age that has so many heroic people.    still, this coronavirus is a warning. societies neglect access to health-care systems and reduce investments in research and development at great peril. diseases are always evolving, and we must continually increase our capacity to understand and fight newly emerging threats.    the best way forward is by strengthening science, training more scientists, and building more labs. countries that are able to do this like the us should share ideas and knowledge as widely as possible.    investing more in science is an appealing economic proposition. given very high rates  of  social  return, basic  research  across a wide range of  activities more  than pays for itself    but this is not about economics. more likely than not, one day a scientist will save your life or the life of a loved one because his or her previous work produced a drug, treatment, or just an idea that made a critical difference. we should invest in scientists to save ourselves and our neighbors. also, we must remember that we have neighbors all over our deeply interconnected world.    global shares take a hit    big shifts in stock markets,  where shares in companies are bought and sold,  can affect many investments in pensions or individual savings accounts (isas).    the ftse, dow jones industrial average and the nikkei have all seen huge falls since the outbreak began on 31 december.    the dow and the ftse recently saw their biggest one-day declines since 1987.        investors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth and that government action may not be enough to stop the decline.    in response, central banks in many countries, including the united kingdom, have slashed interest rates.    that should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy.    global markets did also recover some ground after the us senate passed a $2 trillion (£1.7tn) coronavirus aid bill to help workers and businesses.    but some analysts have warned that they could be volatile until the pandemic is contained.    indian economy    india faces a sharp decline in government revenues and economic growth for at least two quarters as the coronavirus hits economic activity and a fall in investor sentiment impacts privatization plans,  government and industry sources said.    officially, the government is still sticking to the target of achieving 6-6.5% in the next financial year beginning  april, while hoping that a  fall in crude oil prices could help it garner more revenue and contain a  fall in revenue from other sectors but economists and bankers are turning increasingly downbeat about india’s economic prospects, especially as the government is betting on filling its coffers through ill-timed asset sales. we are going to miss the revised revenue targets for the current fiscal year, and will have to lower next year’s targets as well,” said a senior government official with direct knowledge of budget estimates.    he said receipts from much-delayed privatization of  india’s second-biggest oil refiner, bharat petroleum corp, could be lower by at least $2 billion against initial estimates. the company’s share prices have fallen by over 27% since january while the broader  nse  nifty 50 index has fallen by nearly  20%  following a  panic in global markets.    on wednesday, the government suspended almost all visas to the country till april    15  to prevent the spread of coronavirus as cases across the region continue to rise. total cases in the country rose to 73 on thursday, according to the government. another senior finance ministry official said some of the proposed share-shale plans in companies like coal  india, steel authority of  india  ltd (sail), nmdc and ircon have been deferred. the government now expects to raise about rs 50,000 crore ($6.75 billion) against the downwardly revised target of rs    65,000  crore for the ongoing financial year ending in  march, the official said. another senior official in the tax department said receipts have been hit due to a fall in consumer demand as reflected in the lower sales of autos, passenger traffic, hotel bookings, and retail sales.    tour  operators  estimate  january-march  quarter earnings could  fall  by  more  than    60%  from a  year ago as hundreds of thousands of tourists cancel travel,  hitting hotels,  airlines and tax collection for the federal and state governments. india attracts nearly one million foreign tourists a month, and the travel restrictions could impact for the next few months. the situation in india was still far better compared to some other countries hit by a global pandemic, sarkar said.    india annually earns nearly  $30  billion from foreign tourist arrivals,  and the industry is worried that a global spread of the virus will harm already weakened economic growth.        as this situation will take time to recover and economy not only of india but globally is in a recession it up to government how they come up with their measure.    if we look at recent action of us fed and other countries step it took a thought that this pressure is deeper than it looks like and this situation is very different than that happen in 2008 crisis or that in 1998 as that time none of the factories are closed but this time work has been stoped and more importantly economy from past 1 year is facing slow down in many sectors so this will impact small companies badly.    but if we think in another way there will be a shift in a lot of pattern like people will now go for short term investment in the stock market due to uncertainty of life, insurance stocks will be benefited, logistics & distribution network will totally change as factories will now try to procure material from nearest location and there will be an increase in the personal saving of people because of which automakers and real estate sector may be hit hard.    if we estimate, it will take around 1 year to get back in a track from now and all this will happen if the government and central bank continuously come up with relief measure",59,87,-0.19178082060424095,0.14313725490196078,10.0,0.08015039127963743,4.0320601565118555,81.75339910523017,1020,2.6029411764705883,8,6.535294117647059
48612.0,"from the economic point of view, india is confronted today with perhaps its greatest emergency since independence. the global financial crisis in 2008-09 was a gigantic demand shock, but our workers could still get-up-and-go to work, our firms were coming off years of steady growth, our financial system was largely sound, and our government finances were blooming. none of this is true today as we fight the coronavirus pandemic. yet there is also no reason to despair. with the right undertakings and priorities, and drawing on india’s many sources of strength, it can kill this virus back, and even set the stage for a much more hopeful tomorrow.    the rampant spread of covid-19 outbreak, across borders and geographies, has severely impacted almost the whole world and triggered significant downside risks to the overall global economic outlook. steps taken to contain its spread, such as the nationwide lockdown announced by the indian government, have brought economic activity to a near – standstill with impacts on both consumption and investment. india’s real gdp growth decelerated to its lowest in over 6 years in 3q 2019 – 2020 and the outbreak of covid – 19 posted fresh challenges. for most businesses, the slowdown could be in the form of supply disruptions, fall in consumption demand, and stress on the banking and financial sectors. in sum the three major contributors to gdp will all get affected i.e. private consumption, investment and external trade.        figure 1.1: showing quarterly growth in gdp (in %). source: mospi    assessing the exact impact for india is hard with uncertainty on how long the pandemic would last. three likely scenarios for india’s economic situation could be:    an optimistic situation that shows a temporary impact of covid-19 and a v-shaped recovery: under this forecast scenario, the covid-19 pandemic in india could be controlled efficiently by june 2020. the government’s effective interventions may improve healthcare resources and services, and india’s economy could revive from q2 fy2021 onwards.                scenario 1      quarters      q4 fy20      q1 fy21      q2 fy21      q3 fy21–q4 fy22      gdp growth      4.0–4.2%       2.5–2.8%      4.1–4.3%       5.5–6.8%      inflation      moderate      low around the target rate       low      rises but moderate                   figure 1.2: showing an optimistic situation. source: deloitte    a somewhat optimistic scenario with a severe and extended impact of covid-19 and a u-shaped recovery: in the second scenario, india may see limited success in controlling the spread despite the focus on public health-related measures and fiscal policies. with stringent restrictions on movement, the current lockdown may extend until september 2020. some industries will face pressure as rising debt and defaults affect market sentiments, stress the financial sector, and reduce domestic demand.       scenario 2      quarters      q4 fy20      q1–q3 fy21      q4 fy21      q1 fy22– q4 fy23      gdp growth      4.0–4.2%       2.2–3.0%      4.2–4.4%       5.5–7.5%      inflation      moderate      low moderates by q4 fy21        moderate      rises above 4 %       figure 1.3: showing an optimistic scenario with a severe and extended impact of covid-19. source: deloitte    in scenario 2, inflation picks up in h2 fy 2021 as demand revives faster than supply. inflation may increase above the target range (4 percent) for a short time in fy 2021 because of economic overheating. in this scenario, inflation remains 3-4 percent during this period despite weak demand because of a sharper fall in production.    a pessimistic situation, with a prolonged severe downturn leading to a new low-level normal: under the third scenario, the pandemic may spread rapidly (amidst strict movement restrictions) until q4 fy2021. due to the steep decline in demand, the economy will witness production cuts. the situation will ease only in q1 fy2022 after medical interventions. subsequently, the economy will revive modestly as consumers will continue to be wary of spending, which will affect long-term spending. over the next two years, the model predicts the economy to grow by 1.5–2%, lower than it would have grown otherwise, with unequal recovery across sectors.       scenario   3      quarters      q4 fy20      q1–q4 fy21      q1–q4 fy22

with a prolonged severe downturn.     source: deloitte.    impact on the demand side:    private consumption: the lockdown is likely to have a sizeable impact on the economy, most significantly on consumption, which is the biggest component of gdp.    steep fall in the consumption of non-essential goods due to a significant reduction in urban transactions.severe impact on the domestic supply chain disruptions due to the 21 –day lockdown can affect the availability of essential commodities. weak domestic consumption and consumer sentiment will have firms delay their investment and putting additional pressure on growth.    informal sector: rajasthan, punjab, andhra pradesh, chhattisgarh, and gujarat are among the top five states with the highest urban informal workers (non–agriculture)    around 37 percent of regular salaried employees in urban india are informal workers, who will face uncertain income following the stalling of urban activity.inr 1.7 trillion stimulus package, focused majorly on cash transfer and food security was unveiled.the income shock to migrant workers has resulted in a massive reverse migration, the effect of which will only unravel over time.    impact on the supply side:    the shutdown of factories and the resultant delay in the supply of goods in china could result in the supply chain of both raw materials and intermediate goods for indian companies importing from there.while disruption in output in china could impact some indian industries, the economy at large may be relatively insulated given its low reliance on intermediate goods from china as well as the common practice in indian firms of stockpiling inventory.another challenge is the disruptions of the domestic supply chain due to the lockdown, which may create a shortage of inputs for indian firms when they restart their operations.                    figure 1.5: showing supply chain disruptions. source: the economic times.    what has been done so far?    india has already undertaken the following measures to counter the impact from of the pandemic:    a three-week countrywide lockdown and fiscal steps, coupled with monetary measures from the rbi, to provide relief for all, especially the vulnerable and the disadvantaged a government has directed the employers to not terminate or cut wages, particularly that of casual or contractual workers, and low-paid workers to also take paid sick leave and unemployment allowance through the insurance cover government to contribute to both employees’ and employers’ share in the employees’ employees’ provident fund rbi relaxes lending norms for banks, injects cash into the system, slashes interest rates, and relaxes repayments for three months managing the pandemic and the resultant public health crisis  protecting income and employment, particularly for the disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the society    what can the corporates do?    the crisis is a story with an uncertain ending. however, what is clear that the covid-19 has introduced new challenges to the business environment which called for a measured, practical and informed approach from political and business leaders. a company needs to think and act across five horizons:    resolve: address the immediate challenges that covid -19 represents the institution’s workforce, customers, technology, and business partners.resilience: address near-term cash management challenges and broader resiliency issues during virus-related shutdowns and economy knock-on-effect.return: create a detailed plan to return the business to scale quickly as covid -19 situation evolves and knock-on-effects become clearer.reimagination: re-imagine the next normal: what a discontinuous shift looks like and implications for how institutions should re-invent     reform: be clear about how regulatory and competitive environments in india may shift.        figure 1.6: showing the crisis as a lesson to businessmen in assessing risk to their business. source: the economic times     collectively, these five stages epitomize the inescapable of our time: the battle against covid-19 is one that leaders today must win in order to find an economically and socially feasible path to the next normal.    what can the government do?    the government should consider certain measures in order to manage the pandemic. the following steps and the recognition of the likely scenarios for the indian economy can enable policymakers to identify appropriate countermeasures to stem the spread of the pandemic:    build a national database of the reachable physical health infrastructure and medical and para-medical resources the public and private health care facilities can be segregated by labeling a section of accessible hospital beds for treating covid-19 patients only extend additional one-time budgetary support to augment the public health care system in terms of facilities, equipment, and human resources capacity earmark financial resources to provide one-time grants/financial support to research institutions and leading pharmaceutical/biotechnology/medical equipment companies extend the coverage of ayushman bharat and other applicable insurance schemes to covid-19 if not already included tweak the existing customs duty structure for select components, which are essential for manufacturing testing kits, ventilators, etc.enable access to funds for businesses to run their day to day operations and service their debt ensure the smooth supply of essential products and commodities to contain the economic impact of the covid-19 outbreak provide credit support to medium and small enterprises encourage investments such as one-time set off of capital investments made by corporates for income-tax computations    therefore, the question remains whether the stimulus is enough or not – both quantitatively and qualitatively? would it be able to help the economy absorb the shock of the lockdown? compared to what the usa (2 trillion usd), germany (610 billion usd), uk (424 billion usd), france (335 billion usd), spain (218 billion usd), china (78.8 billion usd) and italy (27.3 billion usd), the spending by india (1, 70,000 crore – 22.5 billion usd) may prima facie appear to be insufficient. however, such a comparison is not easy and straightforward because a lot of factors are to be taken into account. in addition, the important factor that needs to be considered is whether at this point in time the country is able to spend more than this or not. against a revised budget estimate of rs. 21,63,000 crore for 2019-20 towards tax collections, the collection as on 31st dec 2019 was to the tune of rs. 13,83,000 crore only with a clearly huge shortfall. in addition, a substantial amount would also have to be spent now to tackle the pandemic which is of utmost priority. on top of it, huge additional spending would jeopardize the fiscal deficit discipline although, at times of emergency, fiscal deficit should not be a matter of concern at all.     it would also have to be seen how long this virus continues to affect india and going by the hygiene standard and herd mentality that we have, the virus continues to affect us beyond 3 months and extends to 6-8 months, quite obviously these packages would be grossly insufficient and more money will have to be pumped into the economy. if the need arises, currency notes will have to be printed and circulated and concerns about higher fiscal deficit should be simply pushed to the backseat. the corporate sector and a section of large-hearted people have also come forward at this time of distress to support the government initiatives in fighting this menace which should provide some financial comfort to the government.    the pandemic has appeared from nowhere as a potential death knell to the world economy which is already under stress and india is no exception. there is no second opinion that this pandemic has hit the world very hard and would continue to do so in the foreseeable future. whether india can emerge from the medical pandemic as well as the economic pandemic relatively unscathed remains to be seen. we will have to take care of our lives as well as the livelihoods of our citizens. as indians, we hope, we shall overcome.  together we can do this and we will.",56,78,-0.16417910325239476,0.11672473867595819,11.254901960784315,0.12095422684018013,4.550342475049798,138.8554524125268,1148,2.692508710801394,1,6.7613240418118465
49073.8,"in today’s day and age of hyper-connectivity, celebrities – dubbed by fraser and brown (2002) as people who are famous for being famous and may or may not always serve others sacrificially – live in glass houses that are open to the prying eyes of the public. notification bars are ever abuzz with news about when these celebrities wake up, what they wear to the gym, what they eat, and where they go on their vacations. in the idealized and idolized eyes with which society views celebrities, this unceasing visibility gives them an all-pervasive influence. the dominance of celebrities in swaying opinions of their acolyte is well-established – from advertisements in the print and pixel mediums, brand endorsements, and integrations, the evidence of exploiting celebrity influence is vast. however, today more than ever before, this influence is creeping away from the world of consumerism and into governance, policy, and politics. with an increasing number of public figures overtly taking strong and stronger political stances, making moves charged with a political motive, and eventually entering the sphere of legislature and bureaucracy, the scope of having a public influence has come to mean much more than it used to, thereby begging the question – how well-placed are personage in the world of politics? should celebrities be allowed to join politics?
 
 
 
 the interplay between the seemingly contrasting worlds of celebrities and policy-makers have come into increasing contact, in india and the rest of the world-leading pop-music artists back presidential candidates, internationally acclaimed actors attempt international diplomacy, films are claimed to be vehicles of political messaging, prime ministerial banquets engage celluloid stars, and so on. the ‘influence’ that stars exert on the world of politics seems to encapsulate an entire spectrum of involvement – at the zenith of which are the celebrities who actually set foot into parliamentary assemblies and councils, to represent the public that they once only influenced.
 
 
 
 although the phenomenon of the seeping of public influence into public policy has stretched through much of the 20th century, choi and berger (2001) suggest that the celebrity-politics connect continues to strengthen, much more than it did a few decades ago, as we trudge further into the century. of the myriad causalities that underlie this circumstance, the global internet, where fame isn’t restricted to the confines of tangible achievement has been theorized to be a significant driver. in her 2009 book, hyde labels this spectacle as a ‘mission creep’, where the enterprise of celebrities is expanding beyond its primary goals.
 
 
 
 a prodigious public following seems to be the parallel between the worlds of politics and personage, which paves the path for celebrities to cross over to politics. celebrities seem to be able to transition into politics with a certain grace, having already learned to live in the public’s eye, and established themselves, allowing the carry-over of their already-known traits as celebrities into their role as policy-makers. the visibility that autochthonous politicians work years to nurture, celebrities already have as they descend into the political sphere. in one of the best-known instances of a celebrity transitioning into politics, ronald reagan walked away from hollywood and into the white house, carrying with him his trademark charismatic on-screen personality that spilled over into his politics. initially serving as the governor of california for 15 years in the late 1960s, reagan served two terms at the oval office. the voters knew who ronald was – those who closely followed the trends of the red and blue – but also those who did not, giving reagan the edge that propelled him towards success. on the other side of the globe, india saw much the same trend as an on-screen persona aiding the creation of an off-screen political career. ramanand sagar’s television series ‘ramayan’, based on the hindu mythological epic, was revolutionary in the pious indian society of the 1980s when television shows were still novel. it has been recounted on many an occasion that audiences would often offer their prayers to the television screen, every time arun govil, who portrayed the deity ‘ram’ made an appearance on screen. having garnered a devout, dutiful fan following, govil, and his other co-actors from the show turned to the world of politics, where their godly association in the public’s eyes helped them make a mark. even the philippines has shown ample evidence of celebrities time and again swooping in to claim political victory with their stardom and popularity, that their opponents lack.
 
 
 
 very often, the sentiment of anti-incumbency seems to be the golden ticket that lets celebrity politicians snatch political power from consummate politicians. indeed, various political theorists suggest that anti-incumbency happens to be amongst the more effective strategies to secure vote banks. until 31st december 2018, ukrainian actor, screenwriter, and director volodymyr zelensky only played the lead in a sitcom that tells the story of a schoolteacher who accidentally becomes the president. it was that winter that zelensky claimed that he was contesting the presidential elections to “change the mood and timbre of the political establishment” and to “bring professional, decent people to power”. zelensky took the premise of his wildly popular show from the reel to the real, as he crushed rival, a seasoned politician, and incumbent poroshenko in a landslide victory. has zelensky proved a better representative of his people than his predecessor? time is yet to deliver its verdict. but the gushes that he invoked in the people of ukraine, and his plea to oust ‘the ruling class’ played their role in assuring zelensky 73% of the plebiscite. in the early 2010s in india, similar anti-incumbent sentimentalities were played into by the many celebrities including musician vishal dadlani, hockey legend dhanraj pillay, singer jaspinder narula, and others – all of whom joined hands with arvind kejriwal’s  ‘aam aadmi’ movement that aimed to rid the existing political system of its ills.
 
 
 
 and so, innumerable celebrities across countries and cultures claim the throne. in fact, a wikipedia page that maintains an inventory of actor-politician spanning the atlas claims that it ‘may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness’ – depicting the sheer number of celebrities who reroute to politics. this begets questioning the congruence of the world of personage and that of politics. 
 
 
 
 in a research article published in 1995, meyer and gamson articulated the possibility of celebrities choosing to politically address only broadly acceptable social causes because they understand their power rests with staying popular, thereby failing to make any appreciable difference. this seems to ring true with some celebrity politicians in india, especially ones who are nominated to the upper house of the parliament but fail abysmally to leave a mark. one of many such representatives is gautam gambhir, a cricketer-turned-politician who has mostly been shunned for his abject performance in the parliament. hema malini, another popular actress who turned to politics, came under heavy criticism when her claim to be a protector of women’s rights wasn’t backed by an effort to fulfill her promises. owing to such instances, research findings such as those by nisbett and dewalt (2016) find that the public often questions the intentions of the celebrities who venture into politics. it may also seem that in entering politics and failing to deliver, celebrity politicians often deprive grass-root political workers of the chance to enter the mainstream of politics.
 
 
 
 however, there is ample evidence from around the globe that goes to prove that celebrities can, in fact, make their mark in the world of governance, independent of their primary identities. take the south indian state of tamil nadu, for instance, where the political ethos has been consistently overshadowed by celebrities from the world of showbiz, for at least the last 40 years. as per data from the ministry of statistics & programme implementation, tamil nadu is amongst the top-performing states in the country, having the second-highest gdp. most celebrities in tamil nadu who approached politics have exhibited extraordinary political will and caliber. the late actor-politician j. jayalalithaa, or ‘amma’, ran successful terms as chief minister and is still considered a mother figure by hordes of her followers. another stalwart in the landscape of tamil nadu, dr. mg ramachandran, continues to be celebrated as one of the most influential chief ministers and is lauded for his large-scale reforms. in being the forerunner of some of the changes that propelled the state towards progress, including easing caste tensions and other communal violence, ‘mgr’ as he is better known, is remembered as much for his governance as he is for his innings on screen.
 
 
 
 more often than not, celebrity engagement in politics has been used to woo voters from the younger strata of the population. empirical studies such as the one by austin, vord, pinkleton, and epstein (2008), have conclusively shown to enhance political engagement by younger voters.  along similar lines, jackson (2008) found that young people are more likely to agree with political positions that are endorsed by politicians. in fact, many modern political theorists are of the belief that the involvement of celebrities in politics allows for otherwise uninvolved or apathetic veins of the demographic, to be active participants in democracy. hillary clinton aimed to do just that when she got the billboard-topping artists beyonce and jay-z to take center-stage at her rally in cleveland, in the weeks leading up to the 2016 us presidential elections – in fact, as multiple sources suggest, this rally did see a surge in millennial supporters. in such a case, it might be in the benefit of the community to have more celebrities endorse and engage in politics in order to nurture a more vibrant and engaged youth.   
 
 
 
 from our vantage point today, the relationship between personage and politics seems to be a central fixture in society and is here to stay. what remains to be done, however, is to ensure the symbiotic course of this relationship – to scrutinize and critique the celebrities who knock the doors of politics and to secure their promises of beneficence and non-maleficence to the public that it seeks to serve. yet, it may seem that these are benchmarks that need to be met by any and all servants of the people – celebrity or not, but in the world that we live in, this is certainly not the case. politicians – celebrity or not, largely happen upon the sphere of governance without a lot of experience backing them and learn to navigate the maze of politics on the job. ultimately, like all things in democracy, the government is of the people and its representatives are of them, and for them. the eventual endorsement of its leaders – celebrity or not – can come, not from data-based analyses and elaborate critique, but from the people. should celebrities be allowed to enter politics? the question remains unanswered. or rather, is answered by the democratic exercise itself – with the beeps of electronic ballots election after election, when the people – the real ‘influencers’, choose.",63,19,0.5365853593099347,0.083248730964467,9.656862745098039,0.14572798414479532,3.9210362916971335,143.54206438262338,985,2.8375634517766497,1,6.966497461928934
49535.6,"frankly, no! the state of the public healthcare system, still vast, is very fragmented and cannot scale up rapidly enough to face the challenge of a pandemic such as covid-19. the origin of public healthcare lies in the british colonial period where such facilities were provided only to british officers and their families stationed in india. from the 1960s onwards, the independent government of india stressed more upon healthcare and it led to the creation of the modern public healthcare system in india. the healthcare system is organized into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. at the primary level are sub centre’s and primary health centre’s (phcs). at the secondary level there are community health centre’s (chcs) and smaller sub-district hospitals. finally, the top level of public care provided by the government is the tertiary level, which consists of medical colleges and district/general hospitals. the number of phcs, chcs, sub centre’s, and district hospitals has increased in the past six years, although not all of them are up to the standards set by indian public health standards. but there are still critical challenges to the existing system.    one of the major areas is the lack of awareness of diseases, especially communicable diseases among the general population of india. this challenge becomes more complicated at the lower strata of society, especially poor households, migrant laborers and homeless people who do not have the proper channels of communication available to get the necessary information from the health experts. add low educational status, poor functional literacy, low accent on education within the healthcare system, and low priority for health in the population, among others and you see the magnitude of the problem. according to a recent study initiated by the faculty and students of iit-hyderabad and iit-bombay, in tier-1 cities, it was found that about 12 percent of the respondents switched from public to private mode during the third week of covid-19. this modal shift was about 9 percent in tier-2 cities and about 7 percent in tier-3 cities. moreover, nearly 48 percent of people said that they did not travel to work during the third week of march, whereas 28 percent had the same frequency of travel to work. when inquired about the cancellation of trips between the cities using major modes of transportation, around 18 percent said they cancelled their flights whereas, 20 per cent of respondents cancelled their train journeys. this indicates that awareness about covid-19 is higher in tier-1 cities, in comparison with tier-2 and tier-3 cities. but national level, state level and door-to-door campaigns along with targeted media campaigns may enable the knowledge of the pandemic to spread fast among the local populace.    the second challenge is access to public healthcare in india. access (to healthcare) is defined by the oxford dictionary as “the right or opportunity to use or benefit from (healthcare)” physical reach is one of the basic determinants of access, defined as “ the ability to enter a healthcare facility within 5 km from the place of residence or work”. using this definition, a study in india in 2012 found that in rural areas, only 37% of people were able to access ip facilities within a 5 km distance, and 68% were able to access out-patient facilities. furthermore, it was postulated that in general, the more rustic (rural) one’s existence – the further one lives from towns – the greater are the odds of disease, malnourishment, weakness, and premature death.    the third is the planning portion related to the preparedness of the pandemic. planning for a pandemic such as covid-19 has never been done extensively in india as we had no recent history of such a communicable disease which spreads rapidly in crowded locations, which about a quarter of the population live in. the recent national lockdown called led to an increase in police violence who have not been sensitized how to deal in such a crisis and the humanitarian crisis facing migrant laborers, an important part of the indian economy, who have lost their jobs and facing a lack of public transport, have to force to walk thousands of miles to reach their native villages. the ongoing slump in the economy has been further exacerbated by the pandemic and the resultant lockdown. and there have been growing complaints by healthcare professionals, who are fighting in the front of this pandemic, of lack of protective personal equipment’s (ppe’s) to protect themselves and their patients from covid-19. the lockdown has hit hiv+ and chronic patients hard who need constant medication to maintain their fragile condition. elderly people, who are often alone and have medical conditions, have been left without essential support. ironically, these are the same group of people who are at an immediate threat from covid-19.    i am optimistically hoping, based on the ingenious and creativity of our citizens, that we tide over these tough times and fundamental changes to our healthcare system are made with this sober learning experience to prevent a repeat of what is happening today.",20,24,-0.09090908884297526,0.0967032967032967,4.46078431372549,0.032060156511854974,1.797137788094938,14.587371212894013,455,2.6527472527472526,0,6.7274725274725276
49997.4,"every prophet of doom, unless he also happens to be a psychopath, hopes that his predictions will not be borne out. this is also true for the epidemiologists and virologists who have been warning the world since january that the novel sars-cov-2 virus poses a severe threat to public health around the world. the name coronavirus itself, is vicious enough to terrify those who otherwise are fearless in the face of any ball game. tracing back the origins of the now pandemic, we find that the coronavirus emerged in wuhan, a city of 11 million people in china’s hubei province, in late 2019. cases of the disease grew by several thousand per day in china in late january and early february, the peak of the epidemic there. the number of infections appearing each day has since plummeted in china, making the outbreak a global pandemic that has engulfed over 214 countries around the globe.    besides being a health crisis, the virus has already brought a major downfall in the world economy with the imf estimating the coronavirus-induced global downturn to be ‘way worse’ than financial crisis. as the coronavirus spreads across the globe, it appears to be setting off a devastating feedback loop with another of the gravest forces of our time: economic inequality. research suggests that those in lower economic strata are likelier to catch the disease owing to their inability to meet the rising drug prices. according to the international labour organization(ilo), covid-19 will have far-reaching impacts on labor market outcomes. beyond the urgent concerns about the health of workers and their families, the virus and the subsequent economic shocks will impact the world of work across three key dimensions.    initial ilo estimates point to a significant rise in unemployment and underemployment in the wake of the virus. based on different scenarios for the impact of covid-19 on global gdp growth, preliminary ilo estimates indicate a rise in global unemployment of between 5.3 million (“low” scenario) and 24.7 million (“high” scenario) from a base level of 188 million in 2019. the “mid” scenario suggests an increase of 13 million (7.4 million in high-income countries). though these estimates remain highly uncertain, all figures indicate a substantial rise in global unemployment. for comparison, the global financial crisis of 2008-9 increased unemployment by 22 million. while self-employment does not typically react to economic downturns, it acts as a “default” option for survival or maintaining income – often in the informal economy. for this reason, informal employment tends to increase during crises. however, the current limitations on the movement of people and goods may restrict this type of coping mechanism.    labour supply is declining because of quarantine measures and a fall in economic activity. at this point, a preliminary estimate suggests that infected workers have already lost nearly 30,000 work months, with the consequent loss of income (for unprotected workers). employment impacts imply large income losses for workers. overall losses in labour income are expected in the range of between 860 and 3,440 billion usd. the loss of labour income will translate into lower consumption of goods and services, which is detrimental to the continuity of businesses and ensuring that economies are resilient. working poverty is also likely to increase significantly. the strain on incomes resulting from the decline in economic activity will devastate workers close to or below the poverty line. the growth impacts of the virus used for the unemployment estimates above suggest an additional 8.8 million people in working poverty around the world than originally estimated (i.e. an overall decline of 5.2 million working poor in 2020 compared to a decline of 14 million estimated pre-covid-19). under the mid and high scenarios, there will be between 20.1 million and 35.0 million more people in working poverty than before the pre-covid-19 estimate for 2020.    who are particularly vulnerable?epidemics and economic crises can have a disproportionate impact on certain segments of the population, which can trigger worsening inequality. based on past experience and current information on the covid-19 pandemic and insights from previous crises, a number of groups can be identified:    those with underlying health conditions and older people are most at risk of developing serious health issues.young persons, already facing higher rates of unemployment and underemployment, are more vulnerable to falling labor demand, as witnessed during the global financial crisis. women are over-represented in more affected sectors (such as services) or in occupations that are at the front line of dealing with the pandemic (e.g. nurses). the ilo estimates that 58.6 percent of employed women work in the services sector around the world, compared to 45.4 percent of men.unprotected workers, including the self-employed, casual, and gig workers, are likely to be disproportionately hit by the virus as they do not have access to paid or sick leave mechanisms, and are less protected by conventional social protection mechanisms and other forms of income smoothing.migrant workers are particularly vulnerable to the impact of the covid-19 crisis, which will constrain both their ability to access their places of work in destination countries and return to their families.    the extent and severity to which the coronavirus pandemic will impact the fight to end extreme poverty is still unknown, but it is expected that the crisis will devastate the world’s most vulnerable people including the world of work. the virus is already disproportionately impacting the poor in wealthy countries, where the most known cases are concentrated. experts are urging the world to prepare to lend extra support to low-income countries to address the pandemic. covid-19 cases are more likely to go undetected or to be under-detected in developing countries that have fewer resources available to tackle a pandemic. countries with large poor populations including brazil, india, indonesia, nigeria, and pakistan have confirmed few cases, but have been slow to respond to the threat, according to npr. preventative care and health education are less accessible to low-income people who are more likely to have pre-existing conditions, catch covid-19, and die from it. people living in poverty are also more likely to hold insecure jobs and cannot afford to stay home sick from work.    in times of crisis, international labour standards provide a strong foundation for key policy responses that focus on the crucial role of decent work in achieving a sustained and equitable recovery to mitigate the impacts of covid-19 on the world of work. these standards, adopted by representatives of governments, workers’ and employers’ organizations, provide a human-centered approach to growth and development, including by triggering policy levers that both stimulate demand and protect workers and enterprises.    policy responses should focus on two immediate goals: health protection measures and economic support on both the demand- and supply-side of the associated cause.    first, workers and employers and their families should be protected from the health risks of covid-19. protective measures at the workplace and across communities should be introduced and strengthened, requiring large-scale public support and investment.second, timely, large-scale, and coordinated policy efforts should be taken to provide employment and income support and to stimulate the economy and labor demand. these measures not only cushion enterprises and workers against immediate employment and income losses, but they also help prevent a chain of supply shocks (e.g. losses in workers’ productivity capacities) and demand shocks (e.g. suppressing consumption among workers and their families) that could lead to a prolonged economic recession.    in such challenging times, many countries have come forward to protect their workers in the workplace with decisive measures to combat the spread of the disease, while ameliorating its pernicious effect on the economy and labor market across the three policy pillars: protecting workers in the workplace, stimulating the economy and labor demand, and supporting employment and income. some of the policies include working arrangements, including telework; occupational safety and health (osh) advice; expanded access to paid sick leave; prevention of discrimination and exclusion. while these measures will no doubt help to contain the pandemic, to respond to the emergency needs it has generated and to pave the way to a gradual recovery, it is clear that more needs to be done. past crises and the experiences of countries, which have reacted too late in the context of the current covid-19 crisis, show that preparedness and early action is critical.    the coronavirus pandemic is a test. it’s a test of medical capacity and political will. it’s a test of endurance and forbearance, for believers a test of religious faith. it’s a test, too, of a different kind of faith, in the strength of the ideas humans choose to help them form moral judgments and guide personal and social behavior. the epidemic forces everyone to confront deep questions of human existence, questions so profound that they have previously been answered, in many different ways, by the greatest philosophers. it’s a test of where all humans stand. what is right and what is wrong? what can individuals expect from society, and what can society expect of them? should others make sacrifices for me, and vice versa? is it just to set economic limits to fighting a deadly disease? how long will we stay that way? and as the epidemic grows worse and brings the disease within fewer degrees of separation for everyone, we may well find that the notion of loving thy neighbor as thyself becomes far more potent.at last i would like to conclude by saying that covid-19 is something we all face as a community, and thus something that we have to solve as a community, not with weapons, but with goodwill and common efforts.",49,96,-0.3241379287990488,0.1607538802660754,8.843137254901961,0.09472318969411697,3.5751441778384314,85.44031710409351,902,2.7328159645232817,0,6.851441241685144
50459.2,"organizations burn a lot of resources to build one iconic image. their brand is not just a picture, a logo, and colors; but an emotional connection with the consumer. it develops by making an impression on the consumers each time they interact with the products or services and it becomes ingrained in the consumers’ minds. now, if it takes great efforts to build such impression, recognition, and trust, why would a firm do something controversial that could burn their own hands?    we see hundreds of ads a day, but only a few get noticed. here is where a controversy comes into play. we would definitely notice something that disagrees with our thoughts or mentally disturbs us. so, such ads stand out. in controversy marketing, a firm creates a controversy which gains them attention really quick, and the word spreads widely. they believe that in order to stand out, they can’t play it safe always. a controversial campaign could be about a social issue that could divide the masses, stating political opinions, or presenting something that doesn’t associate with their image etc.    key features of a well-crafted controversial campaign:    choosing the correct subject. it could be a taboo or a debatable topic. while, both would be controversial, a taboo is more likely to draw a flack than a debatable topic.the campaign should be more focussed on the issue than on the brand itself. as a result, the debate would be about the issue and not the brand.the campaign should always promote a respectful and healthy discussion; not a fight or abuse. it should present the facts and avoid over-sensitising the issues.no issue/current situation should be exploited to a point where it becomes the tone of the firm. if a controversy does not settle down early, over the time it would become a part of the image of the company.the firm should be always prepared with a contingency plan or a proper response in case if the campaign backfires or does not take the expected course.    advantages of controversial marketing:    increasing awareness: a well crafted ad can draw the attention of the unaware audience, making them explore the brands’ product portfolio. some of them, might be potential customers.shifting brand image: a brand always needs to evolve, as per the needs of its target audience. here, a controversial marketing strategy could be used to shift the image in a short span. it could also define the future path for the brand.emotional connect: if a brand is successful in winning the heart of a consumer, it half the job is done. even if a controversy can divide the audience, some will appreciate the message of the brand. they will relate more to the brand and can become loyalists.start a meaningful discussion: particularly if the campaign is designed around a social issue; the campaign not only becomes relevant to the company but also to the society. it breaks the stigma around a topic that people frown to talk about. by communicating to the masses about such a topic, the company eases the air, which can lead to healthy discussions.boost sales: the most important aspect. if the brand is able to build on the sudden increase in awareness among people, it could boost sales and profitability.     disadvantages of controversial marketing:    offensive: in present times, the audience have become highly sensitive and a controversial ad will definitely offend someone. so, we have to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before creating something controversial.ruin brand reputation: as stated earlier, it puts a high risk on brand reputation. for some consumers, a controversy might also become a reason to not buy the product or service. specifically, in case of media houses, if a media house gets involved in controversies often, then that reduces their credibility.while it can increase the awareness in a short span of time, it won’t work in the long run as this attention is short lived.internet. they say, anything that goes on the internet, stays on the internet. due to rise of social media, people have become more conscious of their choices and try to thoroughly evaluate everything. as a result, even one controversial campaign will not be forgotten. years from now, if the company tries to change their opinion on some issue, then these old controversies will again come up and harm them deeply.a controversial campaign can also attract legal penalties, if it ends up leading to disharmony in the society.    examples of controversial marketing strategies:    movie makers frequently follow controversy as a tactic to create a buzz around their upcoming movie.nike came up with “believe in something. even if it means sacrificing everything.” campaign that had colin kaepernick who was outcast from nfl as he kneeled during national anthem to protest against racial inequality in nfl. the ad was a huge success, and nike’s sales rose by31%.the un’s women’s “auto-complete truth” was a huge success as a campaign, and garnered huge accolades from media houses. here, it focused on gender gap and how it was perceived that some roles could never be donned by women.not all campaigns end in success. zomato gathered a lot of backlash in its subtle advertising campaign where they used indian slangs in their banners put up at public places.starbucks red-cup campaign. it created a huge buzz, and boosted sales, but it drove away a portion of christian customers, who were offended by it.    in the end, we can say that controversial marketing is a double-edged sword. on one side, it benefits the firm by increasing its reach to the masses, and making more people conscious about the brand; on the other, it puts the brand value itself at stake. so, it has to be carefully planned, and a backup measure should always be kept ready to reduce the impact in case it backfires.  every such campaign should be thoroughly weighed in for the losses and benefits before execution.",34,49,-0.18072288938888087,0.15779467680608364,5.1568627450980395,0.05100479445067837,2.0831470158194874,26.828521881056822,526,2.629277566539924,1,6.547528517110266

 coronavirus –  coronavirus is a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). the most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease covid-19.
 covid-19 –  covid-19 is infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december 2019.
 how it spreads – people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.
 symptoms – cough, fever, tiredness, aches, pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea, and difficulty breathing (severe cases).

51382.8,"as the coronavirus spreads around the world and countries implement containment measures, energy supply and demand is being disrupted. the impact that country-wide lockdowns and demand slowdowns will have on energy markets will be evolving every day.    impact on energy markets are:    i)slump in wind expansion may support german power prices:    the recent slump in german wind capacity is likely to continue this year as complicated regulations and weakness in the global economic outlook due to the coronavirus are likely to dampen investment in the renewable technology.    this has the potential to restrict future additions to wind output, impacting supply and, in turn, supporting power prices.    ii)chinese industrial gas demand remains weak in march:    chinese natural gas demand from the industrial sector in march was down by almost 25% year on year, according to the chongqing gas and petroleum exchange released over easter, as the impact of the coronavirus continued to weigh on consumption.    iii)reduced energy offtake likely to hit uk suppliers:    a growing number of british energy suppliers could be at risk of colllapsing through reduced energy offtake and cash-flow constraints amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to industry sources polled by icis.    iv)breakdown of european power demand impact :    power consumption continued to soften across key european demand centres through march and the first week of april, while less stringent measures and colder weather has sheltered other parts of europe.    v)brexit set to ensure eu 2020 renewable goals:    while the coronavirus outbreak is already having a significant impact on the european renewables sector, one unintended consequence of the pandemic is likely to be the achievement of eu and member state binding renewable energy targets for 2020. this is due to the consequences of a prolonged downturn in demand, which will not be normalised for by the eu’s official statistics office (eurostat), meaning that renewables look set to make up a higher share of consumption in 2020 across the eu.    vi)spanish prices stay bearish but premium to france to persist:    spanish power prices across the curve are expected to maintain a bearish trajectory throughout the nationwide coronavirus lockdown period which was recently extended until 26 april, with further extensions possible.    nevertheless, forecasts for below-average wind generation would support spanish spot prices, allowing france to continue exporting power to spain. this in turn should keep spanish near-curve contracts at a premium to their french equivalents.    vii)coronavirus hits truck-loaded lng demand:    market sources have indicated the coronavirus has reduced demand for truck-loaded lng around europe, as countries have implemented lockdown measures and low oil prices have made gas less competitive as a transport fuel.    data from terminals in northwest europe shows the impact has not been as significant as originally thought.    viii)europe has found a coronavirus electricity demand floor:    electricity consumption has leveled out in germany, france and italy, after falling for several weeks due to restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus.    but in great britain and spain, demand has continued to drop week on week in recent days, according to an icis model that controls for the impact of temperature across europe’s five largest consumers of electricity.    ix)european power and carbon markets affected by covid-19 – an early impact assessment:    in order to assess the fundamental impact of covid-19 on european power and carbon markets we modelled a scenario in which we accounted for the first data on dropping electricity demand as well as assumed industry production cuts and continued travel restrictions.    x)india defers on lng cargoes as lockdown ramps up:    india buyers are deferring lng cargoes as ports close operations with strict lockdowns in place. this is a concern for sellers in a long market with india one of the key buyers.    xi)eu to reach 2020 renewables goals on coronavirus, brexit:    the combination of brexit and lower demand associated with the coronavirus pandemic should enable the eu as a whole as well as many member states to reach their 2020 renewable targets, according to icis model run.    xii)european power markets yet to hit coronavirus demand floor:    european power demand will continue to drop as governments escalate measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus.    electricity consumption in italy and france fell 16% below expectations over the past seven days, according to an icis model that controls for the impact of temperatures.    three other major power markets studied by icis – germany, spain and the uk – have seen smaller drops, although all are trending down.    xiii)virus demand hit to wipe 9% off 2020 european power prices:    • power demand drop likely    • icis model indicates 6% drop in demand during 2020    • price fall of 9% across europe    a scenario where power demand drops one-tenth through up to june as a result of measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus would see power prices across european markets fall by an average 9% in 2020.    xiv)weather-driven nbp prompt upside possible in week 13:    • temperatures across nw europe to tumble in week 14    • british local distribution zone demand to increase    • eax-nbp premium gaining    incoming cooler weather across britain for week 14 could encourage buying across nbp prompt and near curve contracts in the coming sessions. the drop in temperatures will likely trigger a spike in heating demand which has also increased due to large numbers of people working from home to curb the spread of the coronavirus.    xv)southeast europe braced for falling demand, bankruptcies:    eastern european and turkish energy companies are braced for sharp drops in demand and potential bankruptcies as countries introduce emergency measures in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak.    although the spread of the virus is not as extensive in this region as in italy or spain, the impact of the emergency measures that have been taken is likely to be felt acutely because national economies are fragile.    xvi)europe on course for sharp reduction to power demand:    power sector demand across key european countries is set for a major slump over the coming weeks as countries scale-up their efforts to tackle the spread of the coronavirus.    demand in italy, which has been hit the hardest by the outbreak, has dropped 10% compared to its five-year average for march during the second week of its nationwide lockdown.    as measures to tackle the spread of the virus intensifies across other european countries, a similar drop in demand can be expected, although changes are unlikely to be uniform.    xvii)china’s city gas demand steady despite coronavirus, uncertain elsewhere:    the impact of the coronavirus in china has reduced but gas demand will still end march well down from 2019. city-gate gas demand has been firm but the outlook for other sectors remains a concern.    xix)european gas centres set for april demand destruction:    • eu-wide demand crunch could follow after lockdowns intensify    • residential demand to see brief increase before falling on warmer temperatures    • lng sellers could struggle to deliver into europe    xx)coronavirus effects to ripple in mexico:    mexico’s economy has perhaps never been more exposed to the global supply chains and commodity markets hit by the shocks of the coronavirus and the oil price war, but its president is losing time engaging in denial and political pandering. these will not help his party’s 2021 election prospects if the country’s economic performance falls further as its currency takes a beating amid capital flight.    xxi)china’s gas demand rebounds – satellite data:    emissions of nitrogen dioxide are on the rise in china. this is an indication that economic activity is rising as businesses and industry ramp up activity with the coronavirus impact subsiding.    xxii)spanish virus to impact lng imports:    spain is home to one third of europe’s lng import capacity, so a lockdown has the potential to further gum up the global lng supply chain if, as seems likely, it leads to a drop in demand for gas and a reduced ability to support scheduled imports.    xxiii)european nuclear plant operators gear up to ensure power supply:    european nuclear power availability is expected to remain robust with strict safety measures already being implemented by the major plant operators amid the coronavirus outbreak.    xxiv)bulgarian power traders call for nuclear maintenance change:    bulgaria’s free energy market association asep has called for measures to tackle national power market disruption due to the coronavirus outbreak on 16 march.    xxv)global market moves feed energy downside jitters:    heightened concerns surrounding the economic fall-out from the coronavirus is set to further weigh on european energy markets, traders say.    xxvi)coronavirus likely to lower trader appetite for risk:    widespread remote working due to the coronavirus is set to hit european natural gas and power liquidity, according to traders.    a number of firms have already asked traders to work from home or are expected to do so.    while some trading activities around gas and power dispatching need to be done from a trading floor, most other tasks can be done from home.    however, traders indicated it is unlikely to be business as normal with participants increasingly risk averse away from an office environment.    xxvii)italian gas demand plunges on coronavirus restrictions:    the coronavirus outbreak took a toll on italian gas demand in week 11 as the government extended nationwide restrictions against the spread of the virus.    if restrictions continue, demand and gas prices are likely to fall further as warmer temperatures follow spring, pressuring consumption for heating. power prices are also expected to plunge on the back of weaker gas. gas is italy’s main source for power generation and the marginal fuel, therefore a price maker for italian power.    xxviii)expect weakness in chinese summer gas demand:    • coronavirus impact on lpg to worsen    • china’s big three will have sought some lng volume deferrals as another means by which to deal with the mounting oversupply    • incremental demand for gas and lng this summer will be unusually low    xxix)coronavirus fails to pull down italian power demand significantly:    the italian wholesale electricity market has so far avoided major losses following the outbreak of the coronavirus in the country, the strongest so far across europe.",27,66,-0.41935483420048564,0.08691588785046729,10.490196078431373,0.1340697454132117,4.249706329537834,143.45462759213652,1070,2.591588785046729,0,6.480373831775701
51844.6,"from alibaba to ping an and google to ford, companies around the globe are telling staff to figure from directly from home in a bid to stem the spread of covid-19. such remote functioning at scale is unprecedented and can leave a long-lasting impression on the way people live and work for several years to return. china, which felt the primary impact of the pandemic, was an early mover during this space. as home to a number of the world’s largest firms, it offers lessons for people who are just commencing to embrace the shift. working from home skyrocketed in china within the wake of the covid-19 crisis as companies told their employees to remain home. around 200 million people were working remotely by the tip of the chinese new year holiday. while this arrangement has some benefits, like avoiding long commutes, many employees and firms found it challenging. one employee at a web company quipped his workday changed from ‘996’ to ‘007,’ meaning from nine to nine, 6 days every week, to all or any the time. on the private front, employees found it difficult to manage kids’ home-schooling via video conference while coordinating with remote colleagues. at an organization level, many felt that productivity rapidly tailed off if not managed properly. if done right, remote working can boost productivity and morale; done badly, it can breed inefficiency, damage work relationships, and demotivate employees. these kind of things are happening due to the impacts of covid-19 on the world of work
 here are a few of the learnings from china that will be applicable around the world, looking at the circumstances:
 
 
 
 
 
 designing an effective structure due to the impacts of covid-19 on the world of work
 
 
 
 
 
 teams or whole business units working remotely can quickly end in confusion and a scarcity of clarity. being isolated ends up in uncertainty about who to speak to on specific issues and the way and when to approach them, resulting in hold-ups and delays. that’s why establishing a structure and architecture for deciding and effective communication is vital. here, smaller cross-functional teams are helpful, each with a transparent mission and reporting line, where directions and tasks are easy to implement. this also simplifies onboarding new hires, who can integrate faster in a very tight-knit group, at a time when the broad sweep of the organization isn’t visible or easy to feel. with fewer in each team, there’s longer to urge to understand one another and build the trust that will grow more organically within the office. at ping an insurance, workers are typically grouped in project teams of, at most, 30 members, while larger business units are divided to assist them to stay agile. strong company-wide foundations underpin this, like having a typical purpose and unified goals. providing clarity on what decisions to escalate and which of them is tackled at the team level helps drive progress. to mitigate the consequences of closed retail stores, one leading fashion company founded a technique room and redeployed staff into four cross-functional squads to support its front-line. it designed standard ways for live broadcasting and established internal best practices to encourage front-line staff to use new retail tools to drive sales remotely.
 
 
 
  the lesson: putting in small, cross-functional teams with clear objectives and a typical purpose keeps everyone on the identical strategic course.
 
 
 
 
 
 leading from afar due to impacts of covid-19 on the world of work
 
 
 
 
 
 managing people is one of the foremost difficult elements of remote working, not least because everyone will respond differently to the cultural shift and challenges of the home-working environment. leaders have to energize the entire company by setting a transparent direction and communicating it effectively. offering a powerful vision and a sensible outlook can have a strong effect on motivation across the organization. it’s essential to foster an outcome-driven culture that empowers and holds teams answerable for getting things done while encouraging open, honest, and productive communication. empowering your team in this way pays dividends.wesure, a part of leading internet company tencent, assembled a covid-19 response team5 at the beginning of the year to supply amount, freed from charge to front-line medical workers.
 alan lau, ceo of wesure, credited his team, saying that they had worked nonstop, many from remote locations while inactive during the chinese new year break, demonstrating how responsive they were to the vision.
 for managers, the challenge is to guide, inspire, and direct their team in their daily course of labor, while being physically remote. upping the amount of interaction can even work well here. one chief information officer, responding to a mckinsey survey, said he’s texting the whole company with regular updates because it’s a more human way of communicating than via the official corporate channels. when working within distributed teams, e-commerce giant alibaba increases the frequency of its one-to-one communications with employees to a weekly basis and, in some teams, members submit a weekly report for his or her colleagues, complete with plans for the week ahead. alibaba’s productivity app dingtalk (ding ding) has features inbuilt to facilitate this by allowing managers to send voice-to-text messages to their teams, and to test in on progress.
 
 
 
 the lesson: determining how you communicate is simply as important as what’s being said, and it has to be done confidently, consistently, and reliably
 
 
 
 
 
 instilling a caring culture
 
 
 
 
 
 as companies transition to the new normal, it’s important to acknowledge that some employees are also facing other pressures reception, including caring for his or her children when schools are shut, resulting in feelings of isolation and insecurity. business leaders must respect and address these additional needs. empathy may be a crucial tool here, offering how to attach, promote inclusiveness, and make a way of community in a very barren of physical interaction. increasing social interactions within the team, particularly through one-on-one catch-up, guards against feelings of isolation and demoralization and creates space for people to talk up and share their thoughts. by creating a way of psychological safety for his or her colleagues, being inclusive in deciding, and offering perspective in challenging moments, managers can stay closer to what’s occurring, surface issues, and help their teams solve problems effectively. a similar approach is very important when coping with customers and clients, providing valuable stability and enabling them to navigate unknown waters confidently. as an example, one global bank asked their relationship managers to attach with small-business customers via wechat and video calls to know their situation and help them weather the crisis. to try and do so effectively at scale, the managers are supported through dedicated product programs, online articles, scripts for communicating with clients, and internal training. inclusion is that the ultimate show of empathy. creating outlets for sharing best practices, success stories, challenges, and water-cooler chat are significant to making a person’s connection. giving employees space to pursue personal or social endeavors, providing a transparent span of control, and assigning meaningful tasks also can spur motivation. 
 
 
 
 the lesson: connecting on a private level and instilling empathy within the culture is doubly important when working remotely.
 
 
 
 
 
 finding a new routine
 
 
 
 
 
 moving to remote working risks disrupting the office-based flows and rhythms and it will be easy to hit the incorrect note or miss important virtual meetings thanks to packed schedules. spend time along with your team addressing the nuts and bolts of how you’ll work together. cover the daily rhythm, individual constraints, and specific norms you’ll decide to and anticipate what might get it wrong and the way you’ll mitigate it. how companies plan and review their workflows has to change to reflect this. the challenges of the new working pattern and of not being in one room together will be overcome by creating a digitally facilitated cadence of meetings.
 one leading insurance firm adopted agile practices across its teams, with a daily and weekly ritual of check-ins, sprint planning, and review sessions. as alibaba embraced remote working, it also made sure its meetings were more tightly run. one person is assigned to trace time and manage the outcomes. team members can rate a meeting’s usefulness by employing a five-star system that gives immediate feedback and positive ways forward. to address the challenge of launching a digital business with an oversized remote team, one company created a replacement workflow for product requirements that clearly outlined the use of digital tools, roles, and responsibilities as requirements moved from ideation to validation to delivery stages. reiteration of decision-making structures like this isn’t always necessary when people can communicate directly, but their absence will be keenly felt when remote working kicks in. 
 
 
 
 the lesson: establishing robust working norms, workflows, and features of authority is critical, but only too easy to stint on.
 
 
 
 
 
 adopting a test and learn the strategy 
 
 
 
 
 
 the final lesson: being able to recognize what isn’t working and changing it fast.
 
 
 
 these are the impacts of covid-19 on the world of work. leadership teams that continuously learn actively identify best practices, and rapidly founded mechanisms to share ideas across the organization tend to be most successful within the future. r&d teams at one leading high-tech manufacturer created a productivity target for remote work by estimating their productivity hebdomadally relative to onsite work and identifying levers to enhance it. within four weeks, they had progressed from 50 percent to 88 percent of their baseline. as china’s workforce begins to return to offices, these lessons from a number of its leading companies help as an example of how—with the correct structure, culture, processes, and technology—working remotely can boost productivity and morale. employees who spend less time traveling or commuting and have a much better work-life balance are likely to be happier, more motivated, and prepared to mobilize in extreme situations. embracing remote working allows companies to define a brand new normal that drives productivity and employee satisfaction into the longer term. alibaba launched taobao, by now the world’s biggest e-commerce website, while the staff was working remotely on quarantine during the 2003 sars outbreak. for trip.com, an overseas working experiment in 20147 established the foundations for nice customer service and versatile working culture. hence, bringing together all the weather can enable a brand new way of working that may make your company suited the future—whatever which will hold. these are policies that will mitigate the impacts of covid-19 on the world of work",100,32,0.5151515112488522,0.12753623188405797,10.147058823529411,0.11366782763294035,4.10429066046494,117.64620160009326,1035,2.6734299516908213,0,6.736231884057971
5202.8,"we are living in 2022 and everything has changed post the years. the whole world is running on two phenomena, either #technology or marketing. in a simple sense, earlier if we had to buy something our choice was clear with respect to the product, its price, brand, even shops from where to purchase, and more such factors. there were not many alternates and substitutes available in the market for anything. but now the scenario has changed and we could find ample alternates and substitutes available in the market and not only that, even we have alternatives to markets as well. now we even have a choice among the mode of the market to choose from, i.e. either physical market or virtual market. simultaneously the competition between the businesses has also risen. so a question arises, in such a competitive and dynamic environment how do businesses sustain themselves?     the only solution to this question is advertisement / marketing. marketing plays a very important role in the #success and failure of any company. marketing philosophy is implemented to attract new and existing customers towards their product/service or company. the very common tool used for marketing is advertising. the basic idea behind advertising is to give customers knowledgeable about the product or service in a very interesting and attractive way.    any company should opt for the advertisement model very judiciously. the advertisement tells customers which product they should buy and which to leave. advertisement affects businesses in a very crucial way as they decide whether a product is ready to play in long run or not. most of the products are chosen by the customers because of the advertisement only. if businesses don’t advertise then no one will buy their products. advertisements are the main reason behind the revenues of a company. there are many ways to do advertise through electronic mediums such as televisions, radio, social media, etc., and paper mediums such as newspapers.    wrong advertisements can be harmful to businesses as they provide information in the wrong manner. instead of being the needs of people, it becomes unnecessary for the people. this could result in a big loss for the company and may also hamper the image of the company. for example, tata introduced the nano car in india to have low price car but its marketing went wrong in the eyes of the public and it got failed.    so advertising/marketing affects a business in both positive and negative ways.",15,10,0.19999999200000032,0.12077294685990338,2.0294117647058822,0.03497471619475088,0.8257545923602532,7.239766252313432,207,2.763285024154589,0,6.898550724637682
52306.4,"when the british ruled india, many indians accepted to work under their policy, and they did not try to rebel against the british for their presence in indian lands; they recognized the benefits of british rule. what was the factor that made indians accept the british government? the perception about british-policies (about trading, pay-scale, and positioning in the military) had been done through various marketing channels in such a way that it brainwashed people of the nation, and many were ready to accept the british. so the marketing is like fire when smartly handled; it can destroy your enemies, but when not it can burn you.      marketing is to design and develop a pathway from product or service to the customer through a product, price, place and promotion strategies. marketing depends on a variety of parameters that can be classified broadly, boiling down to vital three. these are ‘what type of customer are marketing team is focusing on (based on gender, age, location, customer-class) (w1)’, ‘what are product specification or applications you need to bring in front of customer (w2)’, ‘what is your product promotion flow path (w3)’, ‘how much time it takes to convey product information to customer (h1)’. these criteria are what i call ‘3w1h’ forms. these basics need to be taken care of while developing a marketing strategy for the upcoming product. however, are they enough? no. there is one more parameter called the feedback mechanism (fm). generally, machines use the feedback mechanism to check output generated is as per input is given or not and if it is not, the input is corrected to get the required output. when it comes to human beings, he/she is surrounded by multiple products daily through social media, tv advertising and so forth. slight uncertainties on either side in observation can make a positive or negative impact on the product on the consumer’s mind. in the feedback mechanism, the marketing team needs to answer only one question “what kind of product image built in the customer mind through promotional activities?” if the product image not built as per expectation, then management has to review and work on 3w1h, as discussed earlier. so let’s elaborate how 3w1h approach works along with feedback mechanism.                   fig.1- 3w1h with fm process can target customer effectively              after deciding the customer range, you can work on other activities. since the customer is conscious about purchasing the product and when the product promoted, the first thing the customer will check is its usefulness, and if his/her answer is ‘yes,’ then the customer will start comparing with similar alternative products in the market. therefore, one should present the product along with some unique thought and express the product in such a way that its image imprinted into the consumer mind. for example, the polio campaign in india. the government had taken the initiative to make india polio-free by spreading awareness through all types of social communication mediums, in which television played a vital role. legendary cinema actor ‘amitabh bachchan’ was selected as an ambassador for this campaign. initially, the advertisement published in which amitabh pleaded people for vaccinating the children within a fixed schedule. the advertisement circulated throughout the nation, and no stone was kept unturned by the government to make this campaign successful. however, much to the surprise, advertising failed miserably to attract a deprived community in polio booth. this promotion failure was because of non-consideration of the customer (w1) and how advertise impacted its application on the customer (w2)? so after analysing failure, experts recommended changes in their marketing campaign like, to focus on major customer (here mainly village woman who generally spend their time in home by watching tv), type of impact on people (people who watched tv during that era, had an image of amitabh as ‘angry young man’). so the campaign improved their advertising by bringing out the same angry amitabh instead of his soft-image, which used in the earlier campaign. so in a very next polio campaign number of people in the polio booth suddenly increased and when feedback is taken from people about such a sudden change, they replied that we don’t want to watch ‘amitabh sir’ getting angry because of us.[i]    in w3, organisation must focus on what kind of channel use to attract the customer. currently, there are a lot of platforms available by which you can market your product. the main agenda you should keep in mind is that how effectively you can engage the customer through marketing, at very first, if you make an impact on customer then only, he can show interest in your product. for example, changes in launching trailers of the upcoming films. till 20th century television and newspaper were crucial factors, but now along with television, marketing team take help of internet resources like youtube, facebook, introducing an article on the pre-trailer phenomenon. increasing the range of promotional devices, broadcast formats and publishing platforms provide a broad range to promote the film and choosing right platform may lead to a massive hit in the box-office.        for the last factor (h1) time, the obvious question that comes to mind is that ‘is time for advertising matters?’, while watching the tv when an advertisement appears, many times we change the channel instead of watching the whole ad or ignore it altogether. you do have an option of ‘skip ad’ when you watch anything online, so one must decide how much time is required to deliver product information during its promotion? delivering product information in less time, may create the possibility that the customer will watch it so it can result in attracting more customers. so, the content will be the king in the marketing. however, as one must have guessed it, this will not work all the time. other factors like the cost of the product, application range, type of customer can also affect the h1. for example, the customer would be more conscious while watching higher-priced product broadcast compare to the lower-priced one. so it would take more time for the marketing team to convince the customer to buy the expensive good than the lower-priced one.    after implementing a marketing strategy as per 3w1h, we need to work on a feedback mechanism in which organization has to collect information about product image generated in customer’s minds through dealers and using feedback-form. not using the feedback mechanism may lead to failure in achieving ‘product sales target’ and can make the situation even worse. take the example of ‘the tata nano-making of world’s cheapest car,’ which was mind-blowing one-of-a-kind projects in indian automobile industry. from the first phase of a marketing campaign, tata nano was on so much continuous limelight that this project was pleased by former american president barack obama.[ii] the curiosity about the product was so high that the sale of then-leading car model maruti-800 was dropped by 20% immediately after unveiling the nano.[iii] however, while marketing the product, an organization built “affordable, garibo ki car” image in customer’s mind, which made customers conscious about what will be their status-quo in society after buying nano? thus, they started giving preference to two-wheelers over nano. during the same time, some instances of nanos catching fire came into focus, which worsened the situation. this case even exacerbates when the team did not work on the feedback mechanism and hence, was not able to change customer perception about nano. later, when nano fire problem was technically sorted out but even then, the marketing team did not make any impactful effort to market the improved safety of the car. therefore, customer’s negative perception remained stuck and the organization did not even come close to achieving selling figures of nano. if the organization had used feedback mechanism, it would have been an entirely different story.     so 3w1h can be an essential factor while developing a marketing strategy for the product along with a reversible fm method. this method can help us to monitor product marketing throughout the phases and can help the marketing team to change strategy whenever it goes into the wrong path.

52768.2,"the business of business is no longer to do just business or increase the bottom line to maximize shareholder value. rather, the concept of business is moving towards a new dimension of sustainable business, the triple bottom line. people, planet, and profits are the core ideologies that are rooted in sustainable business. sustainability is taken into account when companies want to create long-term value creation along with strategies that promote the longevity of the company. as corporate accountability rises, expectations and need for transparency among stakeholders increases therefore companies have started to recognize the need to be sustainable to stay alert and alive.     business globalization that has happened over the previous few decades has made some companies more powerful than some national governments, making it easy for them to exploit inexpensive labor, plunder natural resources, causing severe impacts through pollution on the natural environment, human health, and biodiversity. unfortunately for them, their horrible past has been catching up with them like in the case of child labor issues of ikea & nike, rana plaza accident in bangladesh affecting zara, h&m and other clothing brands, environment pollution by bp, shell, exxon mobil etc. with the emergence of internet and social media these practices can no longer be covered up and silenced, the world has become more educated and less tolerant and therefore with every misdemeanor that is committed brand equity takes a hit. the media is fast picking up on cover-ups, half-truths, and bad corporate behavior and demanding accountability and transparency from corporates. therefore to survive, companies are compelled to adopt sustainability and bring forth the rules for their suppliers as well.     many of the irresponsible company practices and disasters that are witnessed in that last couple of decades were motivated solely by short-termism- the desire for instant gratification- and the appeal of short-term performance incentives. for instance, deferred maintenance and slack leadership were to blame for the 1984 leaks from the pesticide plant union carbide india ltd in bhopal. estimates placed more than half a million casualties from the gas discharge of the plant. finally, union carbide corporation’s 1989 litigation payout came out to today’s equivalent of nearly one billion us dollars. another example where the company was forced to shut down operations was coca cola at its plachimada plant in kerala. the local communities faced acute water shortage after the commissioning of the plant and the company authorities blatantly ignored the community woes. these businesses stated above didn’t respect stakeholder engagement which ultimately lead to their untimely demise.    today’s issues cannot be solved without participation from all stakeholders, and companies with influence should be the torchbearers of change. they need to engage with regulators, communities, societies, suppliers, and ngos for effective and desired outcomes. issues where engagement are required include population growth; global middle-class growth; decline in ecosystems; water scarcity; food safety; material resource security; higher global energy demand; changes in geographic patterns of energy consumption; and increasing climate change regulatory interventions.    by actively pursuing the triple bottom line, the essential possibilities available are:    save expenses by reducing environmental effects; motivate employees and decreased employee turnover;decrease risk through engaging with stakeholders; create a reputation by improving environmental effectiveness ;    in order for companies to commit to sustainability they should have the below objectives in place:    strategy alignment and sustainability: management should ensure alignment between the company’s strategy and its sustainability initiatives. sometimes, there is a divergence between the two concepts making sustainability attempts to look fragile and lacking real dedication and prioritization. for example, toyota is well known for hybrid engine development, but less so for decreasing its reliance on rare earth minerals. toyota decreased its dependence on imports and operational risk, thus reducing its economic hazards in the event of price rises.compliance first, then competitive advantage: compliance must be addressed first and foremost by businesses, which often involves laws on waste management, pollution, and energy efficiency as well as human rights and labor accountability. recent reports show that investors are shying away from compliance hazards progressively. reactive to proactive: as a result of a crisis, many of today’s leading sustainability businesses such as nike, coca-cola, telenor, ikea, siemens, and nestlé have stepped up mainly. for instance, in locations like indonesia throughout the 90s, nike confronted boycotts and government anger for abusive labor practices but turned the tide around. it became a pioneer in the establishment of transparency in 2005 by releasing a full list of the factories with which it contracts and a comprehensive 108-page report revealing conditions and payment in its factories. it also recognized huge problems, especially in its factories in south asia. these businesses have all created more proactive sustainability approaches by acknowledging the effect of sustainability in a crisis.    quantify, including the company situation: all businesses are struggling to quantify their sustainability investment returns. this is a straightforward problem with respect to compliance.     transparency is a precondition for assessing and enhancing sustainability practices. the only way for companies to achieve transparency is through open communication with all key stakeholders based on high levels of information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy as well as an openness to recognize faults and improve practices.    sustainability -triple bottom line- can drive a company’s achievement beyond shareholder value creation by building corporate shared value at its core and help in addressing social &environmental problems. several investors today use esg metrics to evaluate the ethical effect and sustainability practices of an organization. investors are looking at variables like the carbon footprint of a company, water use, community development efforts, and diversity board before investing. companies have started responding to investors by publishing their annual sustainability reports. research indicates that businesses with elevated esg scores have reduced debt and equity costs and that sustainability projects can contribute to improving economic efficiency while encouraging government assistance. it’s only a matter of time, the flow of sustainability nourishes businesses in achieving holistic development for the environment, people and its profits.",58,34,0.2608695623818526,0.14935064935064934,6.03921568627451,0.11658238731583626,2.4623192294361385,71.81475058655514,616,3.074675324675325,1,7.51948051948052
5664.6,"2035, urbanization has changed the world as well as the country. india, the world’s third-largest economy after america with china already surpassing the usa and india surpassing japan to become a larger #economy is now behind china in terms of urbanization with 675 million people living in urbanized cities as compared to china which has 1bn people living in urbanized cities. but what is the cost of urbanization? social cost? is it positive or negative? has it eased our leaving or are we becoming more ai-driven?    technology has always been the driving force for any change in society be it from the industrial revolution in the 18th century to the advancement of the internet. the world has changed massively and is continuously changing with cities transforming into smart ones with more #opportunities and #betterment of life. cities change the future and they are the #engines of economic growth and modernization. with half of the world now living in #urban cities. it is this urbanization that is changing the trajectory of growth miraculously. the present cities which are in the top 10 with the highest #gdp share might not be there in the list of 2035. a report by oxford economics claims that most of the cities will be from asia with new york and london still being the leader as it has deep roots in banking and finance institutes. likewise, population and demographics can become major assets to a country’s growth. india’s burgeoning working-age demographics will present a #unique advantage for themselves and the country is projected to contain several of the fastest-growing cities in the coming years. if we talk about the annual gdp growth rate of the cities which are likely to top the charts, it is also a surprise for the west. not a single city is from the west anymore but all are from the asian block, mainly dominated by india and china, and some cities from southeast asia. bangalore with a massive gdp growth rate of 8.5 percent leads the pack followed by dhaka, mumbai, and delhi. bangalore has a colossal amount of talent pool and the startup culture makes it unique on its own. it is safe to say the next silicon valley of asia and the world is bangalore itself. the amount of startups it generates now is huge. it has the potential to be one of the most urbanized cities in the world. the annual average gdp growth of the entire world, which will be around 2.5 percent, is very minimal for these cities which will surpass it by a fair amount.    surely countries will grow as well as cities will be modernized to cater to the needs of society. migration from rural to urban has been a key reason for the expansion of urban cities. but if we can maintain a balance between both the environment and sustainable growth, the future would be better for us as well as our future generations. climate change is real and it’s affecting us. the impacts of climate change will lead to a worsening of environmental conditions in vast regions in the form of extended heat episodes, more erratic rainfall, drought, and flooding. as we are seeing in europe, china, and pakistan. heatwaves in the entire continent of europe have caused problems in society, likewise, china is experiencing severe heat waves in the country causing rivers to dry up due to which hydroelectricity cannot be generated. pakistan witnessed an unprecedented amount of floods in the region. out of 160 districts,110 districts are underwater and a loss of almost 10bn dollars.  these impacts particularly affect rural agrarian and pastoralist communities of society which heavily depend on the environment. with livelihoods being increasingly disrupted by climate change across the globe, climate-driven migration will likely increase. according to the world bank groundswell report, sub-saharan, and southeast asia could see more than 130 million people move within their countries’ making it a massive amount of migration if no urgent global and national climate actions are taken right now.(rigaud et al., 2018) urbanization also affects the broader prospects of regional environments. regions downwind from large industrial complexes also see huge increases in the amount of air pollution, precipitation, and the number of days with thunderstorms. urban areas generate more rain, but they reduce the infiltration of water and thus lower the water tables.    energy consumption for electricity, transportation, cooking, and heating is much higher in urban areas than in rural villages. for example, urban populations nowadays have more cars than rural populations. almost all of the cars in the world in the 1930s were in the country of the united states. today we have a car for every two people in that country. china, the united states, and india are the top three countries that contribute to the global greenhouse emitter. if that becomes the norm, in 2050 there would be almost 5.3 billion cars in the world, all using the energy of cars and destroying the environment with their global emission.    a large share of migrants will be moving to cities. in many countries, including the g20 ones, urbanization processes are driven by rural-urban migration in response to rapid changes in production, especially manufacturing. india is now trying to catch up with manufacturing after becoming successful in the service sector as it sees an opportunity in front of them. with china 2035 moving towards a more ai-based service sector, it will be the young population of india that will cater to the needs of the world.  better labor market prospects in urban areas pull in young people, while lack of social and economic opportunities as well as environmental drivers of the society push people out of their rural origins to search for a better and higher standard of living in the urban centers. as a consequence, g20 countries like china, india, and south africa have seen major urban growth in the past decades. people who live in urban areas have very different consumption patterns than the residents of rural areas. for example, urban populations consume much more amounts of food, energy, and durable goods than rural populations. in china during the 1970s, the urban populations also consumed more than twice as much pork as the rural populations who were raising pigs. with economic development, people now have declined their consumption as the rural populations of the countries ate better diets.    the health implications of environmental problems include respiratory infections and other infectious and parasitic diseases. capital costs for building improved environmental infrastructure are also costly for example, investments in a cleaner public transportation system such as a subway — and for building more hospitals and clinics are higher in cities than people in rural areas, where wages exceed those paid in rural areas and also the cost to avail the services are much higher in urban cities than in rural areas.    infrastructure does play an important role in the process of urbanization. india, which is now aiming toward a 5 trillion economy, is building up a huge infrastructure to support the economy. infrastructure like roads, bridges, and railway networks are the veins of an economy. just like china created a pool of massive infrastructures to support the economy  being a developing country india has to prioritize sectors for their both inclusive as well as exclusive growth and as india moves towards a manufacturing hub, india needs to move towards better network and fast-paced network to support the movement of logistics  often it is said- roads are the true mirror of the economy as india is moving from highways to expressways it needs to sustain these changes so that shortly you have infrastructures ready to move ahead in leaps and bounds. therefore, to enable macroeconomic stabilization through the expansion of revenue expenditure, ring-fencing of capital expenditure levels as a share of the gross domestic product (gdp) becomes critical.    of course, any number of variables could impact these projections of 2035, from financial recessions to wars, food securities to pandemics, and political uncertainty to rapid urbanization and technological advances.    but one thing’s certain— it is in these coming decades, cities are where many of these factors will converge and play out on the world stage.",44,15,0.4915254153978743,0.07856191744340879,7.362745098039215,0.10783870826714854,2.9882335225225454,80.98686990862856,751,2.7123834886817577,2,6.696404793608522
6126.4,"the advancement in technology and proliferation of the internet has led to the wide exposure of entertainment platforms to a massive audience including teenagers, adults, and senile. in this research paper, we study the impact of over-the-top media on society as a whole especially after the pandemic when there was a sudden shift in remote work culture, educational practices being held online, families spending valuable time together, and majorly the access to viewers. besides the convenience of receiving, the media has certain other advantages too. it has opened up the possibility of streaming ad-free content and undisturbed viewing. also, the customer is truly the king here; he or she can watch what they want and when they want. however, there have been no studies so far that have examined the impact of ott media on society, families, and individuals.     there has been a prodigious change over the past decade as how there has been a shift of television viewers to over-the-top platforms which are now easily accessible to anyone through the internet. the widespread availability of broadband internet has led to the emergence and steady rise to prominence of many platforms, including youtube, netflix, and hbo go. by satisfying media-hungry consumers’ needs and adjusting to their increasingly busy lifestyles, these platforms have found success.    the traditional tv-viewing experience is no longer restricted to real-time or the living room tv. nowadays, users may consume content on laptops, tablets, portable devices, and gaming consoles whenever and wherever they want.  especially the demand for ott media and entertainment has seen a concurrent and large increase during the post-pandemic era, with internet usage increasing from 40% to 100% during that time. the widespread lockdowns have contributed to consumer awareness of the potential of ott media services, enhancing their capacity to influence the daily consumption of content. by offering tailored content recommendations and focused adverts, media firms have also contributed to unlocking additional value for each of their unique viewers by utilizing artificial intelligence (ai) and analytics. with the rise of cross-platform smart voice assistants ensuring the creation of a smart home ecosystem within the homes of the consumers, the transitions underway in the media and entertainment space enable customer-friendly easy content search with voice commands through smart ott platforms will enhance customer experience by every passing day.    india’s ott streaming video market is currently in its second growth phase with total revenues of $3 billion in 2022. to know about the impact of ott platforms in india, it is important to consider consumers’ passive involvement, and interests which helps in analyzing the last action.    according to a survey by rbsa advisors, india’s video ott market is anticipated to grow from roughly usd 1.5 billion in 2021 to usd 12.5 billion by 2030 as a result of access to better networks, digital connections, and smartphones. according to the survey, tier ii, iii, and tier iv cities and the population who speak indian languages would be responsible for the next wave of growth in the ott environment.    the significant expenditures made in original and acquired content by ott services like netflix, amazon, disney+ hotstar, and others will assist subscription video-on-demand in making up 93% of the total ott income (as opposed to 87%) while expanding at a cagr of 30.7% between 2019 and 2024.",29,3,0.8124999746093758,0.10031347962382445,3.127450980392157,0.040803835560542685,1.26730192638108,13.016423543813117,319,2.7523510971786833,0,6.830721003134796
6588.2,"in 2020 india became the 5th largest automobile market in the world. while this fact is good news for the automobile industry, it is also bad news for the environment. how? well, india is also the 3rd largest oil-consuming and green house gas (ghg) emitting nation. according to the assessment report (ar6) of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), during the 2020 lockdown, even though the complete economy was shut yet 36 out of 50 big cities in india had unhealthy air quality.    taking into account the current situation where according to studies, vehicles annually contribute about 290 giga grams of pm2, at the same time, around 8 percent of total ghg (green house gas) emissions in india are from the transport sector and in delhi, it exceeds 30 percent and also in the account of the promises made by india on decreasing carbon emissions niti ayog wants to electrify india’s 2w segment by 2025 and the 3w segment by 2030. india has aimed to create 100 percent electric vehicle (ev) use by 2030. while experts say that this goal is quite ambitious and a hybrid of both electric vehicles (evs) and internal combustion engines (ices) may be seen in india for another decade but india is ushering itself towards its goal in a much faster fashion. and let me give you a few reasons behind it:     so basically, since the war between ukraine and russia seems to be never-ending and russia is an exporter of crude petroleum to the world, the rates of petroleum in the international market are skyrocketing and india is the 3rd largest oil-consuming nation and 90 percent of this oil is being imported, a lot of india’s money is being driven towards that which needs to be controlled. moreover, after the lockdown people are trying to stay at distance from each other and thus the people who can afford are trying to use personal vehicles instead of public ones. this is why india is on its way to becoming the largest market for automobiles, given the population. the effect of rising oil prices (touching the 100rs mark now and then) can be seen in other products as well, transportation costs increasing inflation of course.     therefore the government is hoping to control our import bills with evs (electric vehicles) and hydrogen running vehicles. but (no matter what is being said, there’s always a but in india) here’s a catch if the hasty push is being done then that may further increase our country’s import bill. how? well, currently most of the ev components are imported from china, yet nothing much to worry about, huge indian automobile industries are trying to make evs (electric vehicles) completely made in india, you just need to be informed and smart consumer.     now let’s see what the government is doing about the issue currently:     since battery costs 70 percent of the total manufacturing cost of an ev (electrical vehicle), morth (ministry of road transport and highways) is considering ‘battery as a service business model. the government has allotted a budget of about 100 crores in its latest budget. the government is working on applying the fame ii policy wherein it will spend 86 percent on consumer incentives and 10 percent on charging infrastructure. the government is trying to attract fdis and take help with the import of li (lithium) to make batteries. the government has also promised to build charging infrastructure.     the government has also launched an e-portal that is e-amrit.niti.gov on cop26 summit in glasgow. the portal gives an insight into the major benefits of using evs (electric vehicles). the major benefits talked about are:     zero tailpipe emission (zte) lower running cost lower maintenance less tax environmental benefits easy to drive quite    you might feel that the government is adamant about its “ice to ev by 2030” mission, yet let’s talk about what government can add to this mission. the double dividend hypothesis by david pearce in 1991 states that environmentaltaxation can improve economic and environmental conditions and recyclingrevenues obtained to reduce other pre-existing taxes. norway provides no toll and free parking to people using evs as an incentive. sweden and france give tax levitation to people using evs.    now let’s chitchat a bit upon the problems that consumers think might come if they switch toevs: short driving range of evs long battery recharge time lack of charging infrastructure higher cost battery life high cost of commercial electricity poor roads    if india is looking forward to an ev future then it has to build a good road network because it isproven that carbon emission by ice is lesser on good roads and the driving range of evs is alsogreater on good roads.    now let’s talk about how will this affect livelihood in the future that is by 2040. so let me give yousome of my and some of the expert’s predictions to conclude this article : according to crew report demand for power is expected to rise by 80 percent. about 75 percent of vehicles will be evs. this will usher in the use of railways for large distances. let’s not forget air transport as well. transportation cost of goods to decrease imports to decrease in large amounts. empty petrol stations (better if converted to charging stations) and me writing and you reading about self-solarized evs.    the last one was obvious (chuckles) but since you have read me so far, allow me to share a small, additional yet important information that will be summarized by my last prediction. so, there is this ev trade route that happens to have the philippines, japan, and the us. and here the philippines extracts ni (nickel) for batteries of evs from rio tuba, a mine, japan purifies it and the us makes batteries out of them and uses them in evs. now since demand is increasing, the mining of rio tuba is increasing too which is affecting the rainforests of the philippines and its ecosystem, making us question “is it even a solution?”     and here i predict: high prices and nonavailability of batteries and their parts in the world.",25,11,0.3888888780864201,0.06338028169014084,5.568627450980392,0.033517436353302926,2.2408579549334777,19.037903848676063,568,2.410211267605634,3,6.139084507042254
7050.0,"additionally, the electrification of other forms of road transportation continues to increase. around 25% of all two-wheelers on the road around the globe are electric, however, this trend is mostly restricted to china, india, and asean nations. the world’s worst air quality is in india. even during the covid crisis in 2020, when there were national and state lockdowns, 36 of the 50 cities with bad air quality were in india. internal combustion engines (ice), in particular, have greatly worsened vehicular pollution as a result of the growing number of private automobiles on indian roads.    india is now the third-highest oil consumer and ghg emitter in the world due to the rise in the stock of ice automobiles. to prevent it electrification of cars and other vehicles is a must. according to a number of studies, impediments to ev adoption may arise from the distinctions between ev and ice features.    according to surveys, one of the major obstacles to ev adoption’s rapid growth is the vehicles’ limited driving range. long battery recharge times and a lack of charging infrastructure also have an impact on demand. longer ev driving ranges, quick recharge periods, and an expansion of the charging infrastructure, however, may eventually result inless significant problems.however, ev popularity is mostly driven by features like high environmental friendliness, quick acceleration, and cheaper maintenance and fuel expenses. china, a pioneer in the production of lithium-ion batteries, is gaining from the increase in interest in ev battery packs. by establishing the ambitious target of having enough batteries available to fulfill its own demand by 2024, the european union is making an effort to catch up. plans from several countries the prediction predicts that by 2030, the annual lithium-ion battery consumption for evs would surpass 1,748-gigawatt hours (gwh).     by 2025, the manufacture of battery cells will have reached 1 trillion watt hours (twh), according to the capacity projections that have been currently stated. starting with the surroundings. depending on the assessment, the automobile industry is thought to produce between 10 and 25 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter emissions. these contaminants, which are presently concentrated in the earth’s atmosphere at their greatest levels in the past 650,000 years, are all related to climate change.     by the end of this century, according to studies, the earth’s temperature is likely to increase by much more than two degrees celsius unless considerable changes are made to the world’s industry, energy supply, and consumer habits. these pollutants also caused local pollution and smog, which harmed public health and congested big cities. it was thus no coincidence that automakers started offering alternatively powered vehicles that generated reduced emissions by combining internal combustion engines with electric motors just as the widespread public uproar in reaction to this trend started to grow.     with the introduction of the hybrid prius in japan in 1997, toyota was the first to truly seize this market. in general, there are 4 types of electric vehicles in the market i.e.hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, all-electric vehicles, and conventional vehicles.charging an electric vehicle is always less expensive than purchasing petrol for a conventional vehicle. there is no need for gasoline, saving you money on petrol. the cost of $0.10 per kw is the same as paying less than $1 per gallon of petrol to drive. driving electric vehicles saves drivers, on average, $700 in gasoline expenditures per year.since they don’t release toxins, they are environmentally beneficial. more than 177,758,804 kg of co2 emissions have been cut by electric car drivers. fewer repairs because of an effective electric motor.    you save on running costs since electric motors have fewer components and cause less damage than conventional, non-electric vehicles. greater efficiency, in addition to being lighter, electric vehicles also accelerate more quickly.the best electric car ever made is the tesla model 3 with 20″ überturbine wheels, performance brakes and dual motor all-wheel drive are available for complete control in all weather.    the model 3 can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour (mph) in as little as 3.1 seconds because of a carbon fiber spoiler that increases stability at high speeds. in order to increase redundancy, the tesla all-wheel drive incorporates two separate motors, each of which has just one moving element for optimal longevity and low maintenance. they digitally manage torque to the front and back wheels, unlike conventional all-wheel drive systems, providing far superior handling and traction control.    a fantastic approach to save money and support a stable and healthy environment is to drive an electric vehicle like the nissan leaf, ford focus electric, tesla model s, or chevrolet volt. due to the large number of carbon emissions produced by cars, which are released into the atmosphere, we are more susceptible to pollution and greenhouse gases. the ecology is greatly improved by using electric vehicles. additionally, since electric vehicleshave no environmental effect, they are good for the environment and the economy. there are many elements, but that doesn’t mean they have to be overpowering. you can make an informed choice going ahead by doing a good deal of study on various models, including hybrids. any way you look at it, an electric

7511.8,"we are in an interconnected world. any change in one part of the world will always lead to some #changes in other parts of the world as well, maybe a bit later but surely there will be some change and that is what we are seeing in today’s world. electric vehicles are the change that we are seeing in today’s world. with so many advancements in technology, economies are getting bigger. china might surpass the us and become a #superpower, we will have india inching towards a 15 trillion economy by 2040 and there will be competition among themselves to outshine the other. we are also seeing a paradigm shift toward a more multipolar world from a unipolar world where powers are moving towards certain clusters of the world and everyone wants to be a part of these clusters. but in all these rearrangements taking place. we are in a way creating a better and more sustainable life for our present as well as our future generations.     we have witnessed the cop26 where we saw leaders of top countries taking pledges to create a more sustainable future and the answer lies in a safer and greener planet and electric vehicles occupy a huge chunk of it. internal combustion engines have already peaked, and electric vehicles are getting cheaper and cheaper as governments of every country are actively pushing for electric vehicles as we have seen the joint statement in cop 26 that “as business fleet owners and operators, or shared mobility platforms, we will work towards 100% of our car and van fleets being zero emission vehicles by 2030, or earlier”. this is a step towards the future. india which is home to a large number of two-wheelers and three-wheelers constitutes more than 70% of global sales and more than 80% in india is also a signatory to this statement.   and if we analyze it properly- crude oil, coal, and gas are the most demanded natural resource still in the world. but it’s not free and with the latest scenarios in and around the world, it’s #better to switch to a more safe, efficient, and affordable electric vehicle.    if we look at the economic aspects of electric vehicles, it will surely improve the livelihood of society and in turn the world. evs are on track to rise to 20% of china’s total market by 2025, up from 6% in 2020, and to 37% in the eu, from 11% last year. in the u.s., they are forecast to reach 10% by 2025. india is also not lagging. india’s ev market is still nascent and is forecast to record a 2.4% cagr from 2020 to 2025. electrification is expected to penetrate cars and last-mile connectivity modes like two-wheelers in india by 2030. it is expected about 70% of two-wheeler fleets and 30% of private two-wheelers to be electric by 2030. for passenger vehicles, 40% of fleets and 15%-20% of private cars will be electric by that time.  there are also different steps taken by the government like #tax exemptions, schemes like pli, fame, and battery swapping policy. we must also note that it is estimated that around 10 million direct jobs will be created and indirectly almost 50 million jobs will be created around this sector. if we look at the global picture we are also seeing that there is a price parity between battery vehicles and ice vehicles and with so many advancements in technology we are seeing the prices of batteries coming down with more players getting involved in it with prices estimated to be further down.    as a world leader, countries like china and the usa are in a race to build more lithium-ion batteries so that they are self-sufficient and have the capabilities to further rise to the occasion of being a major exporters in the world. the european union is also not lagging as they are also trying to catch up by producing enough batteries to be self-sufficient by 2025.       crude oils are increasing day by day. we have seen a shortage of gas in european countries mainly due to the russia- ukraine war and everybody is trying to find an alternative to gas and crude oil as it is harmful and it’s one of the main reasons why pollution is such a havoc in the world. one of the major problems of crude oils is oil spilling which is endangering marine species. air pollution caused due to petrol and diesel vehicles is also affecting our planet and if there is less oil then there is less pollution as alternative drivetrains, fuel economy, and shared mobility will impact oil demand; however, nations still won’t reach net-zero by 2050 without doing more. coal is also a great contributor to this pollution environmental impacts associated with using coal as an energy source are particulate emission, ground-level ozone, smog, and acid rain. coal and fuel oil combustion emit fly ash particles into the atmosphere, which contribute to air pollution problems. though it is said that prices of crude oil haven’t peaked yet, they will surely peak by 2040. so, we need to foresee the future to have an alternative in society though we still can’t reach a complete outwash of oil in 2050 we can make sure that other alternatives are ready and self-sufficient.    well, job opportunities are also a major reason why we should consider evs as our future. we realize that the max range of an electric vehicle will be around 350-390 km so people need to stop somewhere to recharge their batteries for at least 40-50 minutes which can provide a time frame in which people can avail restaurants explore shopping complexes and what not. this will help in generating employment opportunities in #hubs like these. there is also a rush in countries like china, the usa, and the european union to build charging stations like this which will accelerate the process of ev vehicles. in this fast, paced world almost every alternative family is having a car but if public vehicles like buses and trains can be changed into electric vehicles this can boost the economy as a whole by creating greater needs with more opportunities in these sectors such as transportation and communication are very much a building block of today’s nation-building process.     however, if we are talking about a world that is greener and fitter we must realize and understand that electric vehicles do have a cost to this planet. there is a huge amount of electric waste which is not so concerning in today’s world. it might be a concern in the world we are all planning to live in. electric vehicles and batteries need rare materials which are not easy to find. electronic waste, also known as e-waste, is any electronic product, or product containing electronic components, that has reached the end of its usable life cycle. unbeknownst to many consumers, electronics contain toxic substances – therefore they must be handled with care when no longer wanted or needed. there are also negative effects on soil when the improper disposal of e-waste in regular landfills or in places where it is dumped illegally, both heavy metals and flame retardants can seep directly from the e-waste into the soil, causing contamination of underlying groundwater or contamination of crops that may be planted nearby or in the area in the future. therefore, we must also not only focus on solely electric vehicles but also on other kinds of fuels like green hydrogen fuels like ethanol which can be generated from agricultural waste. companies play an important part in this change. rather than making it only electric, they should try to make vehicles that are hybrid in nature. they can switch engines so that they are ready to switch from petrol or diesel to green hydrogen and ethanol and also to electric vehicles. the future is now…it’s time to act!",43,29,0.19444444174382722,0.10635155096011817,6.637254901960785,0.05100479445067837,2.6753038785645855,34.530245843109256,677,2.534711964549483,1,6.2924667651403245
7973.6,"are you afraid that robots will take over the jobs of nurses, doctors, and other healthcareprofessionals? are you scared that artificial intelligence will control the world within acouple of years?covid-19 has revealed how vulnerable the health care industry is to change and its need for structural and technological transformation. the covid-19 pandemic has been an unwelcome reminder of just how much health matters not only to individuals and society but also to the global economy. improved health accounted for about one-third of the overall gdp per capita growth of developed economies in the past century.     the traditional boundaries of the industry will dissolve and new roles will emerge in the future of health as exponential innovation propels the industry towards 2040. by 2040, health care as we know it today will no longer exist. there will be a fundamental shift from “health care” to “health.” and while disease will never be eliminated, through science, data, and technology, we can identify it earlier, intervene proactively, and better understand its progression to help consumers more effectively and actively sustain their well-being.     the future will be focused on wellness and managed by companies that assume new roles to drive value in the transformed health ecosystem. as the rate of technological evolution continues to speed up, companies need to look ahead and proactively plan for the future. for the healthcare industry, in particular, this need is even more pressing as it is compounded by the pace of declining health in our society. ray hammond commented on what healthcare will look like in 2040:     “healthcare is one of the few arenas in which every one of us has a stake. the next 20 years will witness a profound change in healthcare, all the more notable given that medical science and healthcare delivery tend to be conservative, slow-moving sectors that are highly resistant to change. the annual global market is currently estimated to be worth around $8.1 trillion, with annual global spending on healthcare forecast to rise to $18.28 trillion by 2040.     with that in mind, we have a collective responsibility to ourselves and to the next generation to determine what that change will look like and the impact it will have on all of us.” how exactly does better health promote economic growth? first, fewer people are likely to die prematurely so the working-age population will increase. when people are healthier, absences from sickness decline and workers are less distracted by managing their conditions or those of their loved ones. also, fewer workers retire early because of health conditions.    the covid-19 pandemic has hit people with underlying health conditions hardest—for example, diabetes, hypertension, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and obesity, which are common across most of the world’s economies. we can improve the health of the world’s population, and that would not only build resilience against future pandemics but also dramatically improve the quality of life of millions of people who suffer the heavy dailythe toll of chronic conditions.    actions or programs such as adopting healthy behavior, expanding access to primary care, and improving medication adherence—could reduce the global disease burden by 40% over 20 years. we found that such a reduction of the disease burden would deliver tremendous benefits: a 65-year-old in 2040 could be as healthy as a 55-year-old today, infant mortality would decline by 65% and 230 million more people would be alive in 2040. more than 70% of the health benefits would come from prevention through healthier environments, healthier behavior, and preventive care (including safe childbirth, vaccination, and adherence to medications that lower risk) rather than treatment of diseases.     one way to improve health is to invest in communities so that children can grow up to live long and healthy lives as adults. the remaining 30% of the benefits we found would come from proven therapies to treat existing health conditions. “future health care and wellbeing” report authored by internationally renowned futurologist, ray hammond presents the likely future developments and trends in healthcare between now and 2040.    among the report’s key healthcare predictions for 2040 are:    • health information from traditional annual physical check-ups and other tests previously only available in surgery or lab will be replaced by data from sensors on/around our ‘smart’ bodies (including in our clothing and, eventually, skin and blood). this will be immediately accessible to us, in real-time.• a new field of ‘predictive medical data mining’ will provide early warnings of physiological trouble ahead or indications of disease as it develops. physicians will have 24/7 real-time reports of their patients’ wellbeing and will be alerted to any change in patients’ data that requires urgent attention.• stem-cell medicine will be a powerful tool in mainstream medicine. for example, replacement human organs for transplant will be grown on demand from stem cells in the lab, with minimal risk of rejection• nano-medicine (in its infancy in 2019) may eventually outperform all other branches of medical science, as scientists create ‘designer drugs that are far more powerful than today’s drugs• artificial intelligence (ai) ‘chatbots’ equipped with deep learning algorithms could relieve emergency room personnel of tending to large numbers of walk-in patients with non-emergencies (e.g. sore throats, utis).        the 10 archetypes will fall into three distinct, but interconnected, categories:    • data and platforms: these archetypes will be the foundational infrastructure that forms the backbone of tomorrow’s health ecosystem. they will generate insights for decision-making. everything else will build off of the data and platforms that underpin consumer-driven health.• well-being and care delivery: these archetypes will be the most health-focused of the three groupings made up of care facilities and health communities—both virtual and physical, and will provide consumer-centric delivery of products, care, wellness, and well-being.    • care enablement: these archetypes will be connectors, financers, and regulators thathelp make the industry’s “engine” run.    all three components need to be fully functioning and integrated for the future of health to come to life.the future of healthcare is shaping up in front of our very eyes with advances in digital healthcare technologies, such as artificial intelligence, vr/ar, 3d printing, robotics, and nanotechnology.     we have to familiarize ourselves with the latest developments to be able to control technology and not the other way around. the future of healthcare lies in working hand-in-hand with technology and healthcare workers have to embrace emerging healthcare technologies to stay relevant in the coming years. so it is worth starting “the future” with the betterment of our health through digital technologies, as well as changing our attitude towards the concept of health as such and towards medicine and healthcare.",41,27,0.20588234991349486,0.10932475884244373,6.098039215686274,0.0684921525480538,2.4666125472937317,42.602118884889464,622,2.789389067524116,3,6.946945337620579
8897.2,"human minds, a fascination in itself carrying the potential of tinkering nature with the pixie dust intelligence, creating and solving the mysteries and wonders with anything but admiration. however, no matter how captivating a human mind can be, it could sometimes be appalled. it could be the hunger or maybe the desire to want more, to go beyond and unravel the limitations, or maybe something like pure greed. humans have never stopped and always keep evolving when it comes to intelligence and this is what makes them the supreme.    intelligence calls out for supremacy and so, what if there was to evolve something that opposed a challenge to the very human minds, to their capabilities while making them question their own importance among themselves? artificial intelligence came as a revolution, havoc when it first came to the light. the concept of making machines does work on their own, like granting machines –the intelligence.    the idea of making machines work like humans came back in the 19s. back then people didn’t believe in such a thing as making a non-living thing work, think, and carry tasks on its own, not to mention, to actually surpass humans themselves in those skills. the facts are it did. by 1997. the greatest chess player, garry kasparov was defeated in a chess game by a machine and this is where exactly, a top skilled human lost to a mere machine created by another who by himself could’ve never defeated him. it was a rule of power, of betterment, of skills, and the granted supremacy. were ai and machines just tools? equipment?  something that helped an unskilled person with his mind and intelligence creates something that could do the skilled work for him with perfection and precision? well initially it was, however, as time passed as humans got drawn to the puzzle of ai, a lot changed. human research went deeper and deeper and as a result, the machines evolved with it.    at present, ai & machines is a growing field. as it develops and improves, it has become a part of the industrial revolution. in industries, most of the laborious work that was once taken care of by humans was now replaced by machines. naturally, with the evolution in machines, its precision, mass productivity, quality control, time efficiencies, and all the other factors made it a better choice. a choice over humans.    this led to fear, a fear of a not-so-distant future, a future where maybe machines will be so evolved that they’ll take over the need of a human employee leading to unemployment. with the population increase around the world, it became the new tech threat for the labor market. then again… how true is it? does ai really oppose a threat? will adapting to technology make millions of people lose their jobs? will it lead to mass unemployment? will the machines really surpass humans? will, the creation take over the creator?    no matter how fearful the future with ai may seem, in reality, it is not that scary. truth is ai is the present reality, it is the key that holds the power to unlock a whole next level of human evolution. technology is growing. there was a time where technology was just an idea, but today that idea has been implemented, it’s working and is carried out. nobody could stop the advancement and growth of artificial intelligence, it’s a wave that is already flowing and we as the present generation and the generations to come to have to learn, to learn to swim in this flow and avoid drowning.    many jobs will be replaced by machines, as ai evolves it’ll keep challenging human minds and their skills. with the present covid 19 situation, contactless cashiers to robots delivering packages have already taken over the usual routine tasks. the jobs of secretaries, schedulers, and book-keeper are at risk too. manufacturing units, agriculture, food services, retail, transportation & logistic, and hospitality are all a part of the ai-affected automation. at an estimation, it is said that around 20 million jobs, especially including manufacturing will be lost to robots. as ai, robotics, 3d printing, and genetics make their way in, even the architects, medical docs, and music composers feel threatened by technology. making us question that will ai even edge us out of our brain jobs too? now that can be terrifying.    however, as much as machines will be replacing few jobs, they’ll also be creating new jobs.  with the economic growth, innovation, and investment around 133 million jobs are said to be generated. these newly enhanced jobs are to create benefits and amplify one’s creativity, strategy, and entrepreneurial skills. so what is the catch?    well, it’s the skills. even though ai is creating 3 times more jobs than it is destroying, it’s the skills that count. ai surged in new job opportunities, opportunities like senior data scientist, mobile application developer, and seo specialist. these jobs were once never heard of but now with ai it’s born, however, to do these jobs or for its qualification, one needs high-level skills and to acquire those skills can be an expensive and time-consuming task. the future generation might be able to cope up with it but the real struggle is to be faced by the present two generations. it’s the vulnerability between the skill gap and unemployment and the youths are the ones to be crushed the most.    therefore, as the advancement of ai becomes inevitable there remains no choice but to adapt, learn, equip ourselves and grow with it. the companies have to work together to build an ai-ready workplace. they should collaborate with the government, educators, and non-profit organizations and work together to bring out policies that could help understand the technologies’ impacts faster while also providing the employees some security. the economic and business planning should be made considerable for minimizing the impact on local jobs and properly maximizing the opportunities.    the employees should be provided with proper tools to carry along with the new opportunities while acquiring ai-based skills for their day-to-day work. new skills should be identified and implemented for the upskilling and continual learning initiatives. employees will have to maximize their robotic quotient and learn core skills. they’ll have to adapt to new working models and understand their roles in the coming future.     howsoever, it’s not like ai will totally take over control, even though ai proves to be a better choice, it still has its limitations at present. first, it’s expensive, secondly, manufacturing machines in bulk is not good for the environment. machines are also very high maintenance, therefore human labor will often come cheaper and so will be considered over machines. underdeveloped countries will find it hard to equip their people with the upskilling and reskilling required for ai workplace and so for ai to play a role in those countries, might take years. ai can also be risky and unethical, as it’s hard to figure out who to be held responsible for in cases where an ai went wrong.    no matter, how advanced ai gets, there are some skills where humans will always have an upper hand i.e., soft skills. skills like teamwork, communication, creativity, and critical thinking are something that ai hasn’t been able to beat us up to yet and so the value of creativity, leadership, and emotional intelligence has increased. although, with machines coming in between humans causing the lack of human-to-human interaction, the humans seem to fade away a little.    with this era, comes the need for good leaders. leaders who are capable of handling both machines and humans together, the ones who are organized enough to manage the skilled and the unskilled employees while providing the unskilled trainees with proper training. leaders who hold profound soft skills and encourage teamwork while working along with machines. the ones who are patient, calm, and optimized.      in conclusion, yes ai and machines are going to be very challenging but there’s nothing humans haven’t overcome. adaptation and up-gradation are going to be the primary factor for survival. as we witness the onset of the 4th industrial revolution, let’s buckle up our seats and race along the highway with the essential fuels (skills) so as to not let ourselves eliminated. after all, this is an unending race with infinity as the end, all we could do is try not to run out of fuel. try not to be outdated.",72,37,0.3211009144853127,0.1459170013386881,7.323529411764706,0.07723583159674152,2.960306097344579,57.69516620276592,747,2.607764390896921,3,6.437751004016064
9359.0,"introduction    ai is rapidly evolving in the employment sector, particularly in matters involving business and finance. finance, management, economics, and accounting are now among the most popular university courses globally; particularly at the graduate level, due to their high employability. however, the evolution of machinery in industries is changing that. according to research, 230,000 jobs in these sectors may be replaced by ai agents in the next 5 years. this is due to the nature of the work, as employees are responsible for tasks such as data analysis and keeping track of numerical information; which machines excel at. large, complicated data sets can be analyzed faster and more efficiently by ai-powered computers than by people. algorithmic trading procedures that produce automated deals are less likely to be produced without minute errors when undertaken by humans. in such matters involving industrial work, a subsection of artificial intelligence is used; namely, machine learning.        machine learning is a term used for the application of artificial intelligence (ai) in systems, which involves them assimilating and processing information by gaining experience. it is mainly concerned with the development of technology and computer programs.     its improvement process is mainly divided into seven steps; which start with the collection of data. this data can be collected from an internal database or perhaps an iot structure. the second and most time-consuming step is cleaning, preparing, and rearranging the data; which involves the recognition of outliers, trends, and missing information so that the outcome is as accurate as possible. the third step consists of formatting data; which is useful if you source your information from a variety of sources. step four is where ai comes into place. self-service data processing tools may be useful if they provide intelligent services for matching data attributes from distinct databases and intelligently integrating them. the data is then arranged to better represent a specific pattern. lastly, the data is divided into two sets: one for training the algorithm and one for analysis.    there are three types of machine learning; supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. the most common of the bunch is supervised machine learning; which is based on accurately labeled data. the machine is given a collection of information, including the outcome of the operation. the rest of the information is referred to as ‘input features’, which ‘supervises’ the machine by guiding it to establish the connections between the variants.    in the case of unsupervised learning, the machine isn’t given labeled sets of data to be divided into, allowing it to recognize and create its own patterns within the information provided. since computers have the capabilities of identifying distinguished similarities, this method helps with the classifying of such data.    reinforcement learning comprises experience-based learning. similar to people, they learn due to a reward and punishment system based on their actions.    these variations of system learning have recently been integrated into business and finance, which is elaborated on in the following passages.    machine learning in finance and banking    there are many ways in which machine learning is used in finance and banking. the most common place it is used is to detect any frauds. fraud is the most common problem in financial service companies and it accounts for billions of dollars in misfortune each year. the most common frauds are credit or debit card usage by a stranger, document forgery, and mortgage fraud.    usually, finance companies keep an enormous amount of their data stored online, and it increases the risk of information being accessed without authorization. with expanding innovative headway, misrepresentation in the monetary business is currently viewed as a high danger to significant information. fraud recognition frameworks in the past were planned dependent on a bunch of rules, which could be effortlessly be bypassed by current fraudsters. therefore, most companies today leverage machine learning to combat fraudulent financial transactions.     machine learning works by looking over enormous informational indexes to distinguish unique or suspicious activities for additional examination by security groups. it works by looking at an exchange against other information focuses – like the client’s record history, ip address, area, and so forth.  depending on the type of exchange taking place, the program can automatically refuse a withdrawal or purchase until the person makes a decision.    examples of fraud detection software used by banks include feedzai, data visor, and teradata    machine learning is also used in algorithmic trading, portfolio management, loan underwriting, chatbots, and improving customer service.    algorithmic trading is an interaction for executing orders using computerized and pre-modified exchanging guidelines to represent factors like value, timing, and volume. an algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem. computer calculations send little parts of the full request to the market over the long run.    in contrast to human dealers, algorithmic exchanging can investigate enormous volumes of information every day and therefore make thousands of trades every day. machine learning settles on quick exchanging choices, which gives human traders a benefit over the market normal. likewise, algorithmic exchanging doesn’t settle on exchanging choices dependent on feelings, which is a typical constraint among human dealers whose judgment might be influenced by feelings or individual desires. the exchanging technique is generally utilized by multifaceted investment administrators and monetary foundations to automate trading activities.    in the banking industry, organizations access a large number of shopper information, with which machine learning can be prepared to work in order to simplify the underwriting process. machine learning calculations can settle on speedy choices on endorsing and credit scoring, and save organizations both time and monetary assets that are utilized by people.    data scientists can train algorithms on how to analyze millions of consumer data to coordinate with information records, search for interesting special cases, and settle on a choice on whether a shopper meets all requirements for an advance or protection. for instance, the calculation can be prepared on the most proficient method to examine shopper information, like age, pay, occupation, and the buyer’s credit conduct.    the benefits of machine learning    as with any form of revolutionary technology, the usage of machine learning has been debated over as its beneficial properties have been weighed against the possible disadvantages. it’s been observed that upon correct usage, it may be used to solve a wide range of business challenges and anticipate complicated customer behavior. we’ve also seen several of the largest it conglomerates, such as google, amazon, and microsoft, introduce cloud machine learning platforms.    technology vs human intelligence    in terms of business, ml can aid businesses by identifying consumer’s demands and formulate a pattern based on them; allowing companies to reach out to such consumers and maximize their sales. it eliminates the need for expenses on some maintenance by reducing the risks associated with unexpected breakdowns and minimizes wasteful costs to the firms.  historical data, a process visualization tool, a flexible analytical environment, and a feedback loop may all be used to build an ml architecture. the input of data is another agitating chore for businesses in the present, which is where machine learning can step in for manual labor. this eradicates the possibility of errors caused by manual labor causing disruptions and provides employees with extra time to handle other tasks.    in the financial sector, machine learning is already utilized for portfolio management, algorithmic trading, loan underwriting, and fraud detection. chatbots and other conversational interfaces for security, customer support, and sentiment analysis will be among the future uses of ml in banking. another aspect of business involving artificial intelligence includes image recognition, which entails a system or program that recognizes objects, people, places, and movements in photos. it identifies photographs using an imaging system and machine recognition tech with artificial intelligence and programmed algorithms.    the downfalls of machine learning    with all the benefits of its advancement, machine learning isn’t the most perfect thing. there are several disadvantages which are information acquisition, time and resources and high errors, and wrong interpretations. one of the major hurdles is the amount of finance needed to invest in machine learning for it to be a successful project. more issues have to do with the fact that ai requires gigantic informational indexes to train on, and these ought to be unbiased, and of good quality. there can likewise be times where they have to wait for that new information to be produced. machine learning needs sufficient opportunity to do the calculations to learn and adequately to satisfy their accuracy and relevancy. it also needs huge resources to work. this can mean extra requirements for the computer to work. another significant problem is the capacity to precisely decipher the results produced by the calculations. you should likewise cautiously pick the algorithms to get the wanted results.    conclusion    there have been various reports in the past and current years which claim that a significant piece of the human labor force will be replaced via robots and machines in the years to come. with excessive innovative work being led in the field of computerized reasoning, many dread that a significant job crisis will unfurl since numerous positions are all the more precisely and productively performed with the use of machines. in countries like japan, mainly computer programs and ai is used in the secondary and tertiary sectors. from cleaning the house to depositing money in banks, everything is done by ai. however, ai cannot replace humans in the future. humans have several capabilities which, even after several technological advancements a machine would not be able to have. these capabilities include creative thinking and creative problem solving, and human connection. for example, when a child goes to a doctor to get an injection, a nurse always relaxes the child to not be afraid of the needle. a machine’s touch would not be able to soothe a child. another example could be how humans tend to share things with each other and be open about it, a machine will not be able to do so since it is only programmed to things it has been told to do. like computers, ai will not replace us but would however complement us to make daily work easier and less time-consuming. without humans themselves, there is no future for

9820.8,"“anything that could give rise to smarter-than-human intelligence – in the form of artificial intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, or neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement – wins hands down beyond contest as doing the most to change the world. nothing else is even in the same league.”     –eliezer yudkowsky, ai researcher    there’s no denying robots and automation are increasingly part of our daily lives. just look around the grocery store, or the highway, they are everywhere. this makes us wonder what if ai can replace human intelligence? what can we do to make ourselves relevant tomorrow? let us try to find the answers to all these questions and more.    let’s first understand what is artificial intelligence –    artificial intelligence or ai basically machines displaying intelligence. this can be seen from a machine playing chess or a robot answering questions on facebook. artificial intelligence can be further broken down into many different types. there are ais designed to do specific tasks, such as detecting a specific type of cancer. however, there are also ais that can do multiple tasks, such as driving a car. there are many types of ais. among the top, most important fields are machine learning or ml, neural network, computer vision, and natural language processing or nlp.    machine learning is the idea of machines being able to prove themselves similar to how a human being learns a new skill. machine learning also allows for the optimization of an existing skill. machine learning is used in many different fields and one such application is entertainment. netflix uses machine learning to recommend more shows that you can watch based on the shows that you have already seen.    neural networks are algorithms that are modeled after the human brain. these algorithms think just like we do which can thereby give similar results to what a human being can give. artificial neural networks are used in medical fields to diagnose cancers like lung cancer and prostate cancer.    computer vision is the idea that computers have visions. this allows them to see things the way human beings do or potentially better than human beings do, depending on the programming, camera used, etc. computer vision is used in autonomous vehicles for navigation from one place to another.    natural language processing is the idea that computers can listen to what we say. an example of this is siri. siri is able to listen to our demands, process what it means, and provide you an answer based on what is researched.    now that we know what an ai is and what it can do, let’s talk about the issue.    will machine replace the human in the future of work?                                                     ais allow for the automation of jobs, thereby replacing what humans already do. this means more job loss and the concentration of wealth to the selected few people. this could mean a destabilization of society and social unrest. in addition to social unrest, ai improves over time. this means it becomes smarter, faster, and cheaper to implement and it will be better at doing repetitive things that humans currently do, such as preparing fast food. it is predicted that ai will improve so much over 50 to 100 years that ai will become super intelligent. this means that it will become even smarter than the most intelligent human on earth. according to many experts such as elon musk, this could cause the end of human civilization. ai could potentially start a war against humans, burn crops and do all sorts of tragedies once reserved for human functions. at that point, in theory, we can not stop it because ai would have already thought of all the obstacles that will prevent its goal. this means that we cannot unplug the machine, in effect ai will replace human intelligence.    but, will this happen in next 10 to 30 years?    no! the field of artificial intelligence is sophisticated enough to do many human tasks that humans currently do. currently, ai is not smart enough to be empathetic to humans and cannot think strategically enough to solve complex problems. ai solutions can be expensive and have to go through many different tests and standards to implement. it also takes time for ai to improve. for example, boston dynamics, one of the world’s top robotics company had a robot in 2009 that needed assistance to walk. fast forward to 2019, not only the robot could walk by itself but it could jump over objects, do backflips and so much more. in addition to the timing, it takes time for the price of any new technological solution to drop to a point where it is affordable. for example, a desktop computer costs around $1000 in 1999 but now you can get a significantly more powerful laptop for the exact same price. ai will go through the same curve.    but what happens after those 10 to 30 years? will ai make human intelligence obsolete? maybe. as we have proven earlier ai will become faster better and cheaper. as this happens, more and more companies will use ai technology to automate more and more jobs to save money, increase productivity, and most importantly, stay competitive. as we have demonstrated, ai will become better through repetition via the use of machine learning. the only difference is that ai will be able to learn faster as time progresses due to the amount of data that is available today. it will also be able to learn from other machines or similar machines to learn how to optimize its tasks or new important skills. however, ai also just not do repetitive and routine tasks better, it will also be able to understand emotional intelligence, ethics, and creativity. this seen in three distinct example- ibm    ibm uses its ibm watson to program the ai to create a movie trailer. fox approached ibm and said they have a movie coming out on ai #scifi horror. they asked ibm if their platform ibm watson could a trailer by reviewing and watching the footage and searching for scary,    will machine replace the human in the future of work?                                                 sad or happy or other moments in the movie that provoked quality emotions based on how the machine was programmed to identify such emotions in a quantifiable manner. ibm watson was able to generate a trailer for the movie morgan. the result, a movie trailer created by machines example – google    in 2018 google demonstrated an ai assistance that could take calls and do simple stuff. the ai was able to set up an appointment! what was more fascinating was that it was able to understand the nuances of the conversation. the receptionist thought it was a human being that was calling her. that is a very primitive version of what is possible with this technology. eventually, it will be able to have conversations just as human beings do, making many sales jobs obsolete. example – ai generated art    in 2018, a paris art collective consisting of three students used artificial intelligence to generate a portrait. it generated the portrait painting by studying a set of fifteen thousand art images on wiki art. it was estimated to be worth between seven thousand to ten thousand dollars. the painting sold at an auction for four thirty-five thousand us dollars.    however, we cannot for sure say that ai will replace human intelligence. this is because we as a society have started asking hard questions and questioning ethics. elon musk founded open ai, a research lab whose whole purpose is to promote and discover artificial intelligence in a way to benefits humanity. in addition to this, there are many factors that affect the long-term outcome of ai replacing human intelligence. like, to what degree will other humans allow for ai to take over? depending on the field, do people even want artificial intelligence to help them? or will they prefer a human counterpart? while we may not be able to control what happens in the long run, we can definitely secure our short-term future.    here are the top five skills that will not become obsolete in the near future    strategic and creative thinking    the ability to think outside the box is very human. there are thousands upon thousands of slightly different possible outcomes that may result from every distinguishable action that the human mind with its ability to judge from experience is programmed for these purposes in a far more sophisticated manner than ai can currently achieve. as the billionaire founder of alibaba, jack ma famously said – “ai has logic, human beings have wisdom”.    conflict resolution and negotiations    with our understanding of the complexities of human-related processes and our ability to improvise and judge, we are far better equipped to deal with conflicts than robots are ever likely to be.    will machine replace the human in the future of work?                                    emotional intelligence and empathy    ai may be able to recognize faces and images but it can rarely successfully read the feelings of those faces. humans, to lesser or greater degrees, are capable of an accurate analysis of emotional subtext. with the application of intuition and the use of delicately worded or elusive languages, through these methods, we are able to properly judge how a person feels.    interpretation of gray areas    robots and computers function well when presented with quantifiable data. however, once the situation enters a gray area, whether this term refers to morals, processes, or definitions robots are more likely to falter.    critical thinking    humans are capable of responding to more indicators of quality than computers are. while an ai system may be able to analyze documents according to the true or false statements made within the text, we can judge whether or not it is well written and analyze the implication of the use of certain words and the overall meaning of the content.",86,28,0.5087719253616498,0.12794612794612795,8.735294117647058,0.08889407032832515,3.529675275190153,79.2046166625377,891,2.612794612794613,3,6.3658810325476995
